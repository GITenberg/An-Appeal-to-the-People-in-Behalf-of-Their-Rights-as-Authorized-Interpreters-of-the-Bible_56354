        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is an
        obvious crisis approaching, in the religious world, on questions of
        the highest moment. In past time such periods of change have been
        preceded by a slow and silent preparation, in which multitudes have
        been led into the same course of thought and feeling. Then, as the
        crisis approached, some efficient leader lifted the last stone which
        sustained the protecting dyke, and rode on the summit of the
        in-rushing tide to notoriety and influence. Thus it was in the day of
        Luther, in the day of Wesley, and at other periods of religious
        movement.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the present
        time there are indications of a great impending change, which has
        been preceded by a long course of unobserved preparation. But it is
        believed that, in this case, it is not to be exhibited, like former
        ones, by leaders forming new sects and parties, amid more or less of
        conflict and commotion, but by the agency of <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
        people</span></em>, and by a healthful, quiet process, which, like
        leaven, shall gradually assimilate surrounding particles till the
        whole be leavened.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The matter
        involved is the great question of questions, to each individual for
        himself, and to every <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page002">[pg

        parent and educator for their children: <span class="tei tei-q">“What
        must we <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">do</span></span> to be saved?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is the object
        of this volume to show that the answer to this great question has,
        for ages, been involved in mystery and difficulty by means of a
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">philosophical theory</span></em> to account for
        the <span class="tei tei-q">“origin of evil,”</span> which, in the
        fifth century, was forced on the people by popes and ecclesiastical
        councils, and which has been sustained by persecution ever since—that
        this theory is the basis of a system of religious doctrine
        incorporated into creeds and churches, which is so contrary to the
        moral sense of humanity, that theologians have failed to render it
        consistent and satisfactory, even to themselves—that <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
        people</span></em> are endowed with <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">principles of common
        sense</span></em> by which they can educe from the works of God a
        system of natural religion far superior, which system is briefly set
        forth, and also the tendencies of the two opposing systems—that
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">both</span></em> systems are so incorporated
        into church creeds, and into theological teachings, that they are a
        compound of contradictions, and all the great religious controversies
        have been efforts to eviscerate the false system from the true, while
        through the long conflict, it is theologians who have proved the
        noble confessors and martyrs for truth—that it is impossible to
        establish the claims of the Bible, or of any other writings, as
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">revelations</span></em> from the Creator, when
        the Augustinian theory is made a part of their teachings; so that the
        real question for the people, is <span class="tei tei-q">“Bible or no
        Bible”</span>—that the leading theological teachers of the chief
        sects in this country have virtually conceded that this theory is
        sustained neither by common sense nor the Bible; and, finally, that
        the people are about <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page003">[pg
        003]</span><a name="Pg003" id="Pg003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to
        cast off this dogma, which for ages has darkened the way to eternal
        life, and by applying the principles of common sense to the Bible,
        thus establish its agreement with the system of natural religion
        herein set forth.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In conclusion, the
        indications of the predicted change are set forth as they are
        manifested in the present position of theologians—of the parochial
        clergy—of the church—of educational interests—of women—of
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Young America”</span>—and of the religious
        and secular press.</p>

        Origin of Evil.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The theory in
        question was introduced into the Christian church, as an article of
        faith, in the fifth century, chiefly by the influence of Augustine,
        an African bishop.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To understand how
        it was brought about, it is needful to bear in mind the distinction
        between facts and the philosophical theories that explain the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">how</span></em> and the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">why</span></em> of
        these facts.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Christ and his
        Apostles taught the fact that all men are sinners, and the way to
        escape from sin and its penalties. As, at first, Christianity
        prevailed chiefly among the uneducated, it was not till some three or
        four hundred years after Christ, that the philosophy of these facts
        agitated the churches. Augustine was a man of powerful mind and great
        learning, and with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page004">[pg
        004]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        other philosophers, speculated as to <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        origin of evil,”</span> or the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">why</span></span> and the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">how</span></span>
        all men came to be sinners.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By the aid of a
        few misinterpreted passages in the Bible, the following theory was
        introduced and mainly by Augustine.</p>

        <div class="tei tei-div" style=
        "margin-bottom: 4.00em; margin-top: 4.00em">

          <span style="font-size: 144%">The Augustinian Theory.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Creator has
          proved his power to make minds with such <span class="tei tei-q">“a
          holy nature”</span> that they will have no propensity to sin, by
          creating the minds of angels and of Adam on this pattern. Adam
          having this holy nature, with no propensity to sin, did sin, and,
          as a penalty, or in consequence, all his posterity commence
          existence without this holy nature, and with such a depraved nature
          that every moral act is sin and only sin until God regenerates each
          mind. This favor is bestowed only on a certain <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“elect”</span> number, whose salvation was purchased by
          the sufferings and death of Jesus Christ.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The rest of the
          race, after death, are to continue an existence of hopeless torment
          in hell.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This depraved
          nature is the <span class="tei tei-q">“origin of evil;”</span> that
          is to say, it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">the cause</span></em> of all the sin and
          consequent misery of our race in time and through eternity. It is
          what is meant by the terms <span class="tei tei-q">“total
          depravity,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“original
          sin”</span> as used by theologians.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At first the
          pope and the church councils refused this theory, but eventually,
          the Augustinian party triumphed; Pelagius and his followers were
          persecuted and driven out of the church, and thus this dogma was
          established as a leading feature in all the creeds and confessions
          of both Catholic and Protestant churches.</p><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So thoroughly
          has it been adopted that, since the time of Pelagius, there has
          been little discussion among the great Christian sects on the
          theory itself. These disputes have chiefly related to certain
          questions connected with this dogma, which will next be
          noticed.</p>

        the Augustinian Theory.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In discussing the
        topics of this chapter it is needful to refer to certain religious
        sects and parties of this country in their relations to the
        subject.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first class
        may be denominated the old school Calvinists, embracing the Old
        School Presbyterian churches, the Reformed Dutch and most of the
        Baptist denominations.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Their views are
        ably presented by the theologians of Princeton and their quarterly,
        and by the Baptist theologians of the Newton Theological Seminary and
        the Baptist periodicals.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second class
        may be called the new school Calvinists, embracing Congregational and
        New School Presbyterian churches. These are ably represented in New
        England by the Andover and New Haven Theological Seminaries and their
        respective quarterlies; and out of New England, by the Theological
        Seminaries of Union and Lane, and their quarterly at
        Philadelphia.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg
        006]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The third class
        are the Arminian sects, including the Methodists and Episcopalians,
        whose views are ably presented in their quarterlies and other
        periodicals in New York and Philadelphia.</p>

          <span style="font-size: 144%">In what does the depraved nature
          transmitted from Adam consist?</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In seeking a
          definite and clear answer to the question, what is the depraved
          nature transmitted from Adam, we find so much vagueness and
          mistiness, that it will be needful to state first what it
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is
          not</span></em>, and then it will be more easy to approximate to
          the affirmative reply.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We find, then,
          that theologians teach that this depraved nature does not consist
          in any of those constitutional powers and faculties of mind, of
          which God is the author. For they maintain that all that God has
          made is perfect and right, and that he is not the creator of that
          which is the cause or origin of sin, inasmuch as this would make
          him <span class="tei tei-q">“the author of sin,”</span> which they
          expressly deny. This depraved nature, then, is something which God
          did not create. This is what is affirmed when theologians say that
          they do not teach a <span class="tei tei-q">“physical
          depravity”</span> which demands <span class="tei tei-q">“physical
          regeneration”</span> on the part of God.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then on the
          positive side, we find that this depraved nature is something that
          mind can be created without, for God made the angels and Adam
          without it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is something
          which does not prevent sinful action, for Adam sinned before it
          existed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is something
          which God can at any time remedy, at least to some extent, by
          regeneration.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is something
          which makes every moral act of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page007">[pg 007]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> every human being sin and only sin until
          regeneration takes place.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is something
          which man created himself, either <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in</span></em>
          Adam, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">before</span></em>
          Adam.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is something
          which man never can or never will rectify, so that he is entirely
          dependent on God for the remedy.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is something
          which most theologians describe as <span class="tei tei-q">“a
          bias,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“a tendency,”</span> or
          <span class="tei tei-q">“a propensity,”</span> or <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“an inclination,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“a
          proclivity”</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">to sin</span></em>, while its opposite is
          called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          holy nature</span></em> which was created by God, and which
          consists in a bias, tendency, propensity, inclination or proclivity
          to holiness.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to
          this, God created the holy nature of angels and our first parents,
          and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">man</span></em> caused the depraved nature of
          all of Adam's posterity.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some theologians
          attempt to define it as an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">unbalanced state of the faculties</span></em>,
          while holiness consists in the perfect balance of the faculties.
          This balanced state of the faculties conferred at his creation on
          Adam has been withheld from all his descendants by a constitution
          formed by God in consequence of Adam's sin. Some theologians define
          this depravity as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">like</span></em> a habit. Others hold that it
          is a state of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">the will</span></em>, sometimes called a
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">disposition</span></em> or <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ruling
          purpose</span></em>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some theologians
          teach that the presence of God's Spirit, in the soul of man is
          indispensable to its right action, and that his depraved nature is
          the result of the <span class="tei tei-q">“deprivation”</span> of
          God's Spirit, which was bestowed on Adam, and is withheld from his
          descendants on account of his first sin. According to this view, a
          holy mind is one which enjoys the presence of God's Spirit, and a
          depraved mind is one that is deprived of it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The old school

          will perform a morally right act in a single instance, until
          regenerated, nor will he do any thing that has any promise, or
          encouragement from the Word of God, as tending to secure
          regeneration. He is as entirely dependent on God as if he had no
          power of any kind. And as the inability, whether natural or moral,
          is all owing to the depraved nature consequent on Adam's sin, the
          fact that man has power to do what he never will do, only adds to
          the misery of the condition thus entailed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Arminian
          sects agree in the fact that the sin of Adam entailed such a
          depraved nature to all the race, as more or less incapacitates for
          right moral action until regeneration takes place.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Episcopal
          Arminians hold to the Catholic view that baptism in part remedies
          the effects of Adam's sin, so that by the use of the means afforded
          by a ministry regularly transmitted from the Apostles, the
          unregenerate can gain eternal life.</p>

          intellectual and other acts of mind.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Calvinists,
          both old and new school, teach that <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          "tei tei-anchor"></a> true virtue, or right moral action in man, is
          choosing to obey God's laws after regeneration takes place.
          Previous to regeneration, every choice is sin and has no moral
          goodness or rectitude. Thus truth, honesty, justice, self-denial
          for the good of others, obedience to parents, are all sin in an
          unregenerate mind, and true virtue in the regenerate mind.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Antinomian
          Calvinist goes so far as to claim that <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every</span></em>
          choice of a regenerate mind is right and holy, just as every choice
          of the unregenerate is sin. Thus the practice of the most hideous
          vices and crimes becomes virtue in the regenerate.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But all other
          Calvinists maintain that after regeneration we can and do sin,

          performed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Arminians
          hold that true virtue consists in obeying God's laws, without
          reference to the question of regeneration. They do not hold, as do
          all Calvinists, that all the doings of the unregenerate are sinful,
          and thus have no promise or encouragement in the Bible as having an
          influence to secure regeneration.</p>

        in the Augustinian Theory.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The difficulties
        involved in the Augustinian theory of <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        origin of evil,”</span> result from these facts. Our only idea of a
        benevolent being is that wherever he has the power to produce either
        happiness or misery, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg
        012]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> he
        prefers to make happiness. Our only idea of a malevolent being is
        that wherever he has this power he prefers to make misery.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Consequently, the
        affirmation that all the sin and misery of man is the result of a
        depraved nature which the Creator has power both to prevent and to
        remove, conveys no other idea than that God prefers to make misery
        when he has power to make happiness, and thus is a malevolent
        being.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If God would make
        all minds perfectly holy, as theologians claim he has power to do,
        all sin would cease. He chooses not to do so, but rather to
        perpetuate the depraved nature transmitted from Adam, which is
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the origin of all evil.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now all classes of
        theologians who hold to the depravity of man's nature consequent on
        Adam's sin, agree that this is the cause or origin of all sin and its
        consequent suffering.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They all agree,
        also, that God has proved his power to make a perfectly holy nature
        in the case of angels and of Adam, and that in consequence of the
        first sin of Adam, every human mind begins to exist with a depraved
        nature, according to a constitution of things instituted by God.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They all agree
        that God can regenerate every human mind, and that this boon is
        withheld, not for want of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The difficulty
        that they have to meet is this—How can the Creator, having done thus,
        be regarded as any other than a malevolent being, the malignant and

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is the

          with a perfectly holy nature. Adam sinned and ruined his own

          relation <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          withdrew from us as he did from him; in consequence of this
          withdrawal, we begin to exist in moral darkness, destitute of a
          disposition to delight in God and prone to delight in ourselves and
          in the world. The sin of Adam therefore ruined us; and the
          intervention of the Son of God for our salvation is an act of pure,

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is the mode

        the Augustinian theory, as it is set forth in both Catholic and

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first extract
        will show that Augustine taught that all men had a common nature in
        Adam, so that his choosing to eat the forbidden fruit was the act of
        each and all human minds which were existing in or with him at that
        time. And thus that it was man and not God that caused our depravity
        of nature.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The extract
        introduced to verify the above was written to St. Jerome, who taught
        that all minds commenced their first existence at or near the birth
        of each. This Augustine denied, and the passage shows not only that
        he taught a common nature which was ruined in Adam, but also that all
        unbaptized infants go to endless punishment for the sin thus
        committed in Adam ages before they were born.</p>

          it is. It is because we fell in Adam; it is for the offense of one
          man that all thus die. The covenant being formed with Adam, not
          only for himself but also for his posterity—in other words, Adam

            divine favor from the whole race. But such evil was inflicted

          the same in one case as in the other; and must not the final result
          be the same? Is not one of these states of mankind fraught with as

            deed. In this state of mind, he who once delighted to pray,
            kneels and rises again, because he can not sincerely worship the
            only God whom he sees. His distress is not on his own account. He
            feels that God has redeemed and regenerated him; but this gives
            him no relief. He feels as if he could not be bribed by the offer
            of all the honors of the universe to pretend to worship or praise
            a God whose character he can not defend. He feels that he should
            infinitely prefer once more to see a God whom he could honorably
            adore, and a universe radiant with his glory, and then to sink
            into non-existence, rather than to have all the honors of the
            universe for ever heaped upon him by a God whose character he
            could not sincerely and honestly defend. Never before has he so
            deeply felt a longing after a God of a spotless character. Never
            has he so deeply felt that the whole light and joy of the
            universe are in him, and that when his character is darkened all
            worlds are filled with gloom.</span><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The preceding
        extracts exhibit a portion of the evidence to prove that the
        Augustinian system is contrary <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page042">[pg 042]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> to the moral sense of mankind, and that
        theologians have failed, by their own concessions, to render it
        consistent and satisfactory even to themselves.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next attempt
        will be to show that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">the people</span></em> are endowed with
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">principles
        of common sense</span></em>, by the aid of which they can educe from
        the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">works</span></em> of the Creator, independently
        of any revealed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Word</span></em>, a system of religion far
        superior to the one based on the Augustinian theory.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our first aim will
        be to designate what is intended by <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        principles of common sense.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is claimed,
        then, that there are certain truths, the belief of which exists in
        every rational human mind. This belief, in some cases, as all must
        allow, results from the constitution of mind given by the Creator,
        and not from any instruction or knowledge gained by other modes. Of
        this class is the belief of every mind in its own existence, and also
        the belief in the existence of other things beside ourselves.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are other
        truths universally believed by every rational mind, where there may
        be room for question as to whether this belief is acquired or the
        result of constitutional organization. But this question is waived,
        as of little practical consequence for the present purpose of this
        work.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fact on which
        the name and classification of these truths rests is, that the belief
        in them is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">common</span></em> to all rational minds, and is
        regarded as so indispensable to true rationality, that whenever any
        person shows by words and actions that a belief in any one of these
        truths does not exist, he is regarded as deranged, that is to say,
        his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">reason</span></em> is said to be more or less
        destroyed.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg
        043]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This, therefore,
        is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">test</span></em> by which we are to distinguish
        these principles of common sense from all other knowledge. They are
        truths which are believed by all rational persons, so that the
        disbelief of any one of them, evinced in words and actions, is
        universally regarded as proof of a deranged mind. In such cases, a
        man, in common parlance, would be said to have <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“lost his mind,”</span> or to have <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“lost his reason;”</span> inasmuch as he is lacking in
        some of those peculiar features which constitute man a rational
        being.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this work the
        question is also waived as to the number of truths which are to be
        included in this class. In regard to certain of them there can be no
        dispute. Of those involving any discussion, there probably will be no
        occasion to speak in this work. The writer does not claim that the
        common people, or that metaphysicians, when they speak of
        <span class="tei tei-q">“common sense,”</span> always refer to what
        is here designated by this term.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All that the
        writer claims is that there are certain truths, the belief of which
        is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">common</span></em> to all minds, either as the
        result of constitutional organization or of acquired knowledge; and
        that these can be classified by this <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">test</span></em>,
        viz., that men universally talk and act as if they believed them, and
        when they cease to do so, are regarded as more or less insane.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Moreover, it is
        claimed that it is proper to call them <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">principles of common
        sense</span></em>, because they are that kind of sense which is
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">common</span></em> to the whole race, and also
        they are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">often</span></em> referred to, both by
        metaphysicians and by the common people, by this term.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the following
        chapters it will be shown that by the application of these
        principles, a system of natural religion can be gained from the works
        of the Creator <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page044">[pg
        044]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> by
        the same methods that men employ in all the ordinary concerns of
        life, and that thus we are as fully qualified to gain religious
        knowledge and peace as we are to secure temporal comfort and
        prosperity.</p>

        of any revealed Word.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In all systems of
        religion the first article relates to the existence and character of
        the Deity to be worshiped and obeyed. The first principle of common

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the widest
          sense of the word, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          antecedent, without which a given change will not occur, and with
          which it will occur. This is the leading idea in every use of this
          word.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then there are
          two classes of causes; the first are <em class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Occasional

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, fire
          applied to powder is the producing cause of an explosion, while the
          placing of the two together is the occasional cause of it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The idea of a
          producing cause is one which probably is gained when we first
          discover that our own will moves our own limbs and other things
          around us. When we will to move a thing, and find the intended
          change follows our volition to move it, then we can not help
          believing that our own mind <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">produced</span></em> this change. At the same
          time we gain the idea of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">power</span></em> to produce this change, and
          the belief also that the thing changed had <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no
          power</span></em> to refrain from the change.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our only mode of
          defining the idea of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">producing cause</span></em>, of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">power</span></em>
          and of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">want of power</span></em>, is to refer to
          occasions when, by willing, we cause changes, and thus become
          conscious of the existence and nature of these ideas by
          experience.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So also we have
          no mode of defining our <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sensations</span></em> but by stating the
          occasions in which we are conscious of them. For instance,
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">whiteness</span></em> is the sensation we have
          when we look at snow, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">blackness</span></em> is the sensation we have
          when we look at charcoal.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same idea of
          causation and power in ourselves which we have when we make changes
          by our will, we always connect with any thing which by experiment
          and testimony we find, in given circumstances, to be an invariable
          antecedent of a given change. Our minds are so made, that whenever
          we find an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">invariable</span></em> antecedent of a given
          change, we can not help believing that this antecedent <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">produced</span></em> the change, just as we
          believe our own will produces changes in our bodies and in things
          around us. And if any person <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page046">[pg 046]</span><a name="Pg046" id="Pg046" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> were to talk and act as if lie did not
          believe this, be would be regarded as having <span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Moreover,
          whenever men, by frequent experiments, find that a given change is
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">invariably</span></em> preceded by a certain
          antecedent, they can not help believing that the antecedent has
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          that the thing changed has <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          idea of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          power</span></em> always exists whenever men find an <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">invariable</span></em> antecedent to some
          change. It is by finding what are thus invariably connected as
          antecedents and consequents that men learn what are <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">causes</span></em>,
          and what are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">effects</span></em>, and what are the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">powers</span></em> of things around us.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here, then, we
          have these as principles of common sense believed by all men,
          viz.:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1. Every change
          (in matter or mind) has a producing cause as an antecedent.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. Every
          invariable antecedent of an invariable sequent is a <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">producing</span></em> cause, and the thing
          changed has no power to refrain from that change.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. A producing
          cause, in appropriate circumstances, has power to make a given
          change.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now every man,
          however unlearned, can judge for himself whether these principles
          of common sense exist in his own mind, as here set forth. For
          example, let any person take a magnet and discover, day after day,
          that when it is placed near a piece of iron it draws it to itself;
          let him find also, by testimony from others, that this is
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">invariable</span></em> and fails in not a
          single instance, and the inevitable result is a belief that the
          magnet is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">cause</span></em> of the moving of the iron,
          just as the mind is the cause of the movement of our bodies. So
          also there is a belief that the magnet, in given circumstances,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page047">[pg 047]</span><a name=
          "Pg047" id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> has <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">power</span></em>
          to move the iron, as our will has power to move our body. So also
          there is a belief that the piece of iron, in the given
          circumstances, has <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">no power</span></em> to refrain from being
          thus attracted.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We see, then,
          that it is a universal fact, that when there is a change of any
          thing, or any new mode of existence, every sane man believes there
          is some <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">producing cause</span></em> of this change.
          Even the youngest child exhibits this principle as a part of its
          mental organization. And should a person be found who was destitute
          of a belief in this truth, so that he should talk and act as if
          things came into existence and were changing places and forms
          without any causes, he would be called insane, or a man who had
          <span class="tei tei-q">“lost his reason.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our minds being
          endowed with this principle, we find the world around us to be a
          succession of changes which we trace back to preceding causes,
          until we come to the grand question, <span class="tei tei-q">“Who,
          or what first started this vast system of successive
          changes?”</span> Only two replies are conceivable. The first is
          that of the Atheist, who, contradicting his own common sense,
          maintains that, in some past period, all this vast system of
          organization and changes began to exist without any cause. The
          other reply is, that there is a great, eternal, self-existent
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">First
          Cause</span></em>, who himself never began to be, and who is the
          author of all finite existences. This being, the Creator of the
          heavens and the earth, we call God.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next
          principle of common sense is that by which we gain a knowledge of
          the natural attributes of the Creator. It is this:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Design</span></em>
          or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          048]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          of an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">intelligent</span></em> designer, and the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">nature</span></em> of a design proves the
          intention and character of its author.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The mind, as has
          been shown, is so formed that it can not believe that any existence
          can commence without some antecedent cause. The existence of
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">unorganized</span></em> matter, however, would
          be no proof that the cause was an <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intelligent
          mind</span></em>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But when any
          existence is discovered where there is an adjustment of parts, all
          conducing to accomplish some determinate end, no person can examine
          and understand its nature and adaptations without the accompanying
          belief that the cause of that contrivance was a mind endowed with
          the capacity of adjusting means to accomplish an end, and thus an
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">intelligent</span></em> mind.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor is it
          possible, when the object which any design is fitted to accomplish
          is clearly discovered, to doubt the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">intention</span></em> of the designer. We can
          not help believing that it was the intention of the contriver to
          accomplish the end for which his contrivance is fitted.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As an example to
          illustrate the existence of these principles, even in the simplest
          minds, if a savage should find in the desert a gold watch, nothing
          could lead him to believe that it sprang into existence there
          without any cause. If he should open it and perceive the nice
          adjustment of the wheels and all its beautiful indications of
          contrivance, he could not believe that the mind of an animal, or
          that any but an intelligent mind constructed its machinery. If he
          should have all its movements explained to him, and learn how
          exactly all were fitted to mark the passage of time, it would be
          equally impossible to convince him that the contriver did not
          design it for such a purpose.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Very early
          childhood gives evidence of the existence <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page049">[pg 049]</span><a name="Pg049" id="Pg049" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> of these principles. An interesting instance
          of this is recorded by a celebrated philosopher, who, to test the
          existence of these principles in the mind of his child, planted a
          bed with seeds arranged in the form of the letters which spelled
          the child's name. When the green symbols had sprung from the ground
          and were discovered by the delighted child, the father in vain
          endeavored to force his belief that the letters came without
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          cause</span></em> and without <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">a design</span></em>. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“No, father. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">intended</span></em> to have them come up and
          spell my name!”</span> And thus infancy itself maintains the
          principles which are our guide to the Great Source of all finite
          existences.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another
          principle of common sense lends us still further aid in arriving at
          the natural attributes of the Creator. It is this:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tei tei-div" style=

          change.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All the business
          of life rests on a belief of this truth. Our confidence that the
          sun will rise, the seasons return, the ocean and rivers flow, the
          mountains remain; and in thousands of other things that regulate
          our plans and conduct, all depends on this implanted belief that
          things will continue according to our past experience till there is
          evidence of a change. A man who acted as if he disbelieved this
          principle would be regarded as having <span class="tei tei-q">“lost
          his reason.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When, therefore,
          we have gained the idea that the Creator is an <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intelligent
          mind</span></em>, we necessarily believe that his mind is
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">such as
          we have ever known in past experience</span></em>, that is, a mind
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">like our
          own</span></em>, endowed with reason, intellect, susceptibilities
          and will. We can not conceive of any other kind of mind, because we
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page050">[pg 050]</span><a name=
          "Pg050" id="Pg050" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> have never had any
          experience or knowledge of any other kind.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The only respect
          in which we can conceive of the Creator as differing from our own
          minds is in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          which are exhibited in his works.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus by the use
          of the principles of common sense we have gained the positions that
          there is a Being who is the Author of all finite existences, whose
          mind is like our own in natural faculties, while in the extent of
          these faculties, as exhibited in his works, he is far beyond our

        Philosophy.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the preceding
        chapter we have applied the principles of common sense to gain
        evidence of the existence of a Creator, or Great First Cause, whose
        natural attributes we can discover only by <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
        nature</span></em> of our own minds.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This being so, our
        next step in seeking after God is to examine the construction or
        nature of our own minds.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The only way to
        discover the nature of a thing is to examine what are its qualities,
        how it acts, and how it is acted upon. This also is the same as
        studying the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">philosophy</span></em> of things. For when
        learned men set forth any branch of philosophy, they only teach the
        qualities of certain things, how they act, and how they are acted
        upon.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page051">[pg
        051]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whoever,
        therefore, gives attention to the nature of mind so as to discover
        its qualities, how it acts, and how it is acted upon, is studying the
        philosophy of mind, or mental philosophy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature of
        mind</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">the philosophy of mind</span></em>, and
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mental
        philosophy</span></em> are terms all expressing the same thing.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, the only
        possible way in which any person can discover the nature of another
        mind is by a knowledge of his own. We first learn by experience the
        qualities of our own mind, how it acts and how it is acted upon, and
        then, by a process of reasoning, we learn that there are other minds
        around us, and that they have similar qualities.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The study of
        mental philosophy, then, is directing attention to the nature of our
        own mind, and thus discovering the nature of other minds.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It differs from
        all other studies in this respect, that all men have the materials of
        the knowledge sought in their own minds, and are required simply to
        direct attention to their own mental states and acts.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This being so, the
        common people are as fully qualified to settle all questions in
        regard to the nature or philosophy of their own minds as the most
        learned and profound metaphysicians or theologians can be. All that
        is requisite to success is, that they direct their attention to the
        subject by suitable methods.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will be found,
        on examination, that the common people have secured a written system
        of mental philosophy as real as has ever yet been furnished by any
        metaphysician or theologian, while it is free from the great defects
        which render many works on mental science unpractical and
        repulsive.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page052">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This—<em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the people's system
        of mental philosophy</span></em>—it will be the object of what
        follows to set forth.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In attempting it,
        we shall find that mankind, in the uses of every-day life, have
        arranged the various acts and states of mind into classes and
        subdivisions, and have given names to these classes, and to the
        specific acts or states included in these classes. These
        classifications and terms are recorded by lexicographers in their
        dictionaries.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All words have
        that meaning which is attached to them by the people who use them.
        The business of the lexicographer is, not to settle what meaning
        ought to belong to words, but rather to state the meaning which men
        actually attach to them in writing and speaking.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In setting forth
        the people's system of natural philosophy as contained in
        lexicographies, we find that almost every word is used to express
        several meanings, similar in some respects and diverse in others. In
        consequence of this, we only can attempt thus much for mental
        science, as for many other subjects, viz., to describe the thing
        intended, and then to select the word most frequently used to express
        this idea, as set forth in our dictionaries.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This, then, is the
        course pursued in the following pages. A description is set forth of
        a given act or state of mind, sufficient to identify it from all
        others, and then the word is selected from dictionaries of our
        language which has most frequently been used by the common people in
        expressing the idea intended. Thus every person who cares enough
        about the matter to read and think, can decide as well as the most
        celebrated metaphysician, whether the description given is
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page053">[pg 053]</span><a name="Pg053"
        id="Pg053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">true to his own
        experience</span></em>, and also whether, according to
        lexicographers, the word selected is frequently used by man to
        express this idea.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The writer, in her
        first attempts to investigate the philosophy of mind, examined the
        works of Stewart, Reid, Locke, Edwards, Brown, Coleridge, Cousin,
        Jouffroy, Coombe, Spurtzheim and several others. More recently some
        attention has been given to the writings of Sir William Hamilton,
        Hickok and others. The result has been the conviction, that most of
        these works contain the people's system, more or less disguised with
        diverse modes of classification and new technics, which tend to
        render the whole subject misty and perplexing. And still more
        unfortunately, some of them attempt the discussion of questions which
        are unpractical and often unintelligible.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As an example,
        certain metaphysicians have attempted to prove that there is nothing
        existing but mind, and that all which we believe to be realities
        without ourselves are not so, but merely ideas in the mind.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Other
        metaphysicians have attempted to meet their arguments, and to prove
        that the world around us is a reality.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Both attempts have
        ended in books which seem to have no sort of <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">practical</span></em>
        influence either way. Men can not help believing that there is an
        outer world, and that the men and things that affect our senses are
        realities, and such arguments neither lessen nor increase this
        belief.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meantime, the
        books written to prove or disprove this truth are incomprehensible to
        most common minds, at least the writer of this work has in vain

        Powers and Faculties.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have seen, in
        the preceding chapters, that our only mode of gaining a knowledge of
        the natural attributes of God, is by the study of the nature of mind.
        We have seen also that the only way to discover the nature of mind is
        to examine what are its qualities, and how it acts and is acted upon
        in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">our own
        experience</span></em>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When we discover
        what our minds actually do, we find out what they have <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">power</span></em> to
        do. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">faculties</span></em> of mind are its <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">powers of
        acting</span></em> as they are exhibited in our own experience.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The following
        presents a brief outline of the powers and faculties of mind as they
        have been classified and named by <em class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our ideas are
        often referred to as divided into two classes, viz., ideas gained by
        the senses, and ideas that pass through the mind without the aid of
        the senses.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it is often

          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">best</span></em> for us. Thus, when sick we
          have tempting fruit and nauseous medicine before us, with power to
          choose either. Our intellect decides that the medicine is best for
          us, but our strongest desire is for the fruit.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In such a case
          we have power to choose <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of the thoughts
          which continually pass through the mind, we find that some are
          attended with a feeling of the real existence of the objects of our
          thoughts, and others are not so attended. For example, we may think
          of a man with a certain form carrying a dagger and going to commit
          murder, and with this, a feeling that no such thing is really
          existing. Again, we may have this same idea attended with the
          conviction that it is a reality.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This feeling of
          the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our minds are so
          made, that we necessarily believe not only that things <em class=

          really existing at the present time, but that things <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>
          occur that are not now in existence. For example, we believe the
          sun will rise to-morrow morning in another place nearer toward the
          north or south than it did the present morning. We believe the tide
          will rise higher or lower on a coming day than it did the present
          day. And thus multitudes of events are believed to be in the
          future.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Those things
          which really do or will exist, in distinction from those we may

          To believe that things exist when they do not, or that things are
          not existing when they are, involves certain pain, disappointment
          and mistake.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our great

          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          sense</span></em>. This, as has been shown, consists in the
          necessary belief of certain truths by all men.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <em class=

          which these truths are identified and distinguished from all other

          believed them, and that when they fail to do so, they are regarded
          as having <span class="tei tei-q">“lost their reason.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The truths thus
          necessarily believed are the foundation of the process called
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">reasoning</span></em>, which is a mode of
          establishing other truths by the aid of those already believed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These principles
          of reason or common sense are often called by other names, such as
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">intuitions</span></em>, <em class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus all the
          powers of mind are arranged in the four general classes, viz.,

          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">common
          sense</span></em>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In regard to the
          power of mind called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">reason</span></em>, what is claimed here is,
          not that either the common people or metaphysicians have usually
          thus clearly set forth what is here so described and named; but
          that all men, learned and unlearned, allow that there are truths
          which are necessarily believed by all mankind; that these are the
          foundation of all <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">reasoning</span></em>, and that they
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          So when any one is found to lack a belief in certain of these

          thoughts.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The mode by
          which the succession of our thoughts is regulated is intimately
          connected with several subjects to be discussed, and will,
          therefore, first receive attention.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will be found
          that our <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sensations</span></em> and <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">perceptions</span></em> vary in vividness and
          distinctness according to the strength and permanency of certain
          feelings of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">desire</span></em> which coexist with them.
          For example, we are continually <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page060">[pg 060]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> hearing a multitude of sounds, but in respect
          to many of them, as we feel no desire to know the cause or nature
          of them, these sensations are so feeble and indistinct as scarcely
          ever to be recalled to the mind or recognized by any act of memory;
          but should we hear some strange wailing sound, immediately the
          desire would arise to ascertain its nature and cause. It would
          immediately become an object of distinct and vivid perception, and
          continue so as long as the desire lasted.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While one
          sensation becomes thus clear and prominent, it will be found that
          other sensations which were coexisting with it will become feebler
          and seem to die away. The same impressions may still be made upon
          the eye as before, the same sounds that had previously been
          regarded may still strike upon the ear, but while the desire to
          learn the cause of that strange wailing sound continues, the other
          sensations will all be faint and indistinct. When this desire is
          gratified, then other sensations resume their former distinctness
          and prominency.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">conceptions</span></em>, in like manner, are
          affected by the coexistence of emotion or desire. If, for example,
          we are employing ourselves in study or mental speculations, the
          vividness of our conceptions will vary in exact proportion to the
          interest we feel in securing the object about which our conceptions
          are employed. If we feel but little interest in the subject of our
          speculations, every conception connected with them will be
          undefined and indistinct; but if the desire of approbation, or the
          admonitions of conscience, or the hope of securing some future good
          stimulate desire, immediately our conceptions grow more vivid and
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page061">[pg 061]</span><a name=
          "Pg061" id="Pg061" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> clear, and the
          object at which we aim is more readily and speedily secured.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The mind is
          continually under the influence of some desire. It constantly has
          some plan to accomplish, some cause to search out, or some
          gratification to secure. The present wish or desire of the mind
          imparts an interest to whatever conception seems calculated to
          forward this object. Thus, if the mathematician has a problem to
          solve, and this is the leading desire of the mind, among the
          various conceptions that arise, those are the most interesting
          which are fitted to his object, and such immediately become vivid
          and distinct. If the painter or the poet is laboring to effect some
          new creation of his art, and has this as the leading object of
          desire, whatever conceptions seem best fitted to his purpose are
          immediately invested with interest, and become distinct and clear.
          If the merchant, or the capitalist, or the statesman has some
          project which he is toiling to accomplish, whatever conceptions
          appear adapted to his purpose soon are glowing and defined, in
          consequence of the interest with which desire thus invests
          them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From this it
          appears that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">chief end</span></em>, or leading object of
          desire of the mind, will in a great measure determine the nature
          and the succession of its conceptions. If a man has chosen to find
          his chief happiness in securing power and honor, then those
          conceptions will be the most interesting to his mind that best fall
          in with his object. If he has chosen to find happiness in securing
          the various gratifications of sense, then those conceptions that
          most coincide with this desire will become prominent. If a man has
          chosen to find his chief enjoyment in doing the will <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg 062]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of God, then his conceptions will, to a
          great extent, be conformed to this object of desire. The current of
          a man's thoughts, therefore, becomes the surest mode of determining
          what is the governing purpose or leading desire of the mind.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But there are
          seasons in our mental history when the mind does not seem to be
          under the influence of any governing desire; when it seems to
          relax, and its thoughts appear to flow on without any regulating
          principle. At such times the vividness of leading conceptions,
          which otherwise is determined by <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">desire</span></em>,
          seems to depend upon our past experience. Those objects which, in
          past experience, have been <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">associated with emotion</span></em>, are those
          which thus begin to glow in the distinct lineaments with which
          emotion at first invested them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In past
          experience, all conceptions which were attended with emotion were
          most distinct and clear, and therefore, when such conceptions
          return united with others, they are the ones which are most
          interesting, and thus most vivid and distinct. Thus, in our musing
          hours of idle reverie, as one picture after another glides before
          the mind, if some object occurs, such as the home of our youth, or
          the friend of our early days, the emotions which have been so often
          united with these objects in past experience cause them to appear
          in clear and glowing lineaments, and the stronger have been the
          past emotions connected with them, the more clearly will they be
          defined. It appears, then, that there are two circumstances that
          account for the apparent <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">selection</span></em> which the mind makes in
          its objects of conception. The first is the feeling that <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">certain conceptions
          are fitted to accomplish the leading desire of the</span>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page063">[pg 063]</span><a name=
          "Pg063" id="Pg063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style=
          "font-style: italic">mind</span></em>; and the second is, that
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">certain
          objects in past experience have been attended with
          emotion</span></em>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But there is
          another phenomenon in our mental history which has a direct bearing
          on the nature and succession of our conceptions. When any
          conception, through the influence of desire or emotion, becomes the
          prominent object, immediately other objects with which this has
          been associated in past experience begin to return and gather
          around it in new combinations. Thus a new picture is presented
          before the mind, from which it again selects an object according as
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">desire</span></em> or <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">emotion</span></em>
          regulates, which, under this influence, grows vivid and distinct.
          Around this new object immediately begin to cluster its past
          associates, till still another scene is fresh arrayed before the
          mind.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In these new
          combinations, those objects which are least interesting continually
          disappear, while those most interesting are retained to form a part
          of the succeeding picture. Thus, in every mental picture,
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">desire</span></em> or <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">emotion</span></em>
          seems to call forth objects which start out, as it were, in bold
          relief from all others, and call from the shade of obscurity the
          companions of their former existence, which gather around them in
          new and varied combinations.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus it is shown
          that the chief mode by which we regulate the nature and succession
          of our thoughts is by the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">choices</span></em> we make of our objects of
          pursuit. Whatever we choose as our <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">chief
          end</span></em>, or leading object of desire, becomes the regulator
          of our emotions, our desires and our thoughts. Thus we have power
          to control our thoughts aright only by choosing right objects of
          pursuit. We have power to regulate them in this <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page064">[pg 064]</span><a name="Pg064" id="Pg064"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> way, and but very little power to
          control them in any other.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The mere
          determination to think only on certain subjects in which we feel
          very little interest avails but for a short time. Speedily the mind
          returns to its natural course, and brings forward only those
          objects connected with our chief objects of desire and pursuit.</p>

        susceptibilities of pleasure and pain which are affected by the
        conduct of ourselves or others, in reference to rules of <em class=

        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In order to a more
        clear view of this part of the subject, it is important to inquire as
        to the manner in which the ideas of <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">right</span></em> and
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">wrong</span></em> seem to originate.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The young child
        first notices that certain actions of its own are regarded with
        smiles and tones of love and approval, while other acts occasion
        frowns and tones of displeasure.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next, it perceives
        that whatever gives pleasure to itself is called <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good</span></em> and
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">right</span></em>, while whatever causes
        unpleasant feelings is called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">bad</span></em> and <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wrong</span></em>.
        Moreover, it notices that there is a right and wrong way to hold its
        spoon, to use its playthings, to put on its clothes, and to do
        multitudes of other things. It thus perceives, more and more, that
        there are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">rules</span></em> to regulate <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page065">[pg 065]</span><a name="Pg065" id="Pg065"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the use and action of all things, both
        animate and inanimate, and that such rules always have reference to
        some plan or design.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As its faculties
        develop and its observation enlarges, the general impression is
        secured that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">all</span></em> plans and contrivances of men
        are designed to promote enjoyment or to prevent discomfort, and are
        called good and right just so far as this is done. At the same time,
        all that tend to discomfort or pain are called bad and wrong.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In all the works
        of nature around, too, every thing that promotes enjoyment is called
        good and right, and the opposite is called evil and wrong.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At last there is a
        resulting feeling that the great design of all things is to secure
        good and prevent evil, and that whatever is opposed to this is wrong,
        and unfitted to the object for which all things exist. The question
        whether this impression is owing solely to observation or partly to
        mental constitution is waived, as of little practical
        consequence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the experience
        of infancy and childhood, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">law of sacrifice</span></em> is speedily
        developed. It is perceived that much of the good to be gained, if
        sought to excess, occasions pain, so that there must be a certain
        amount of self-denial practiced, which, to the young novice,
        sometimes involves disappointment and discomfort. It is also seen
        that frequently two or more enjoyments are offered which are
        incompatible, so that one must be relinquished to gain the other. It
        is perceived, also, that there is a constant calculation going on as
        to which will be the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">best</span></em>—that is, which will secure
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the most
        good with the least evil</span></em>. And the child is constantly
        instructed that it must avoid excess, and must give up what is of
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page066">[pg 066]</span><a name="Pg066"
        id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> less value to secure the
        greater good. All this training involves <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sacrifices</span></em> which are more or less
        painful, so that a young child will sometimes cry as it voluntarily
        gives up one kind of pleasure as the only mode of securing what is
        best.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is perceived,
        also, that there is a constant <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">balancing</span></em> of good and evil, so that
        a given amount of enjoyment cancels or repays for a certain amount of
        evil. When a great amount of enjoyment is purchased by a small degree
        of labor or trouble, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">compound result</span></em> is deemed a good,
        and called right; on the contrary, when the evil involved exceeds a
        given amount in comparison to the good, the compound result is called
        evil and wrong.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus is generated
        the impression that there is a law of sacrifice instituted requiring
        the greatest possible good with the least possible evil, and that
        this is the great design of all things.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The impression is,
        not merely that we are to seek enjoyment and avoid pain, but that we
        are to seek the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">greatest possible</span></em> good with the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">least
        possible</span></em> evil, and that in doing this we are to obey the
        law of sacrifice, by which the greatest good <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is to be
        bought</span></em> by a certain amount of evil <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">voluntarily</span></em> assumed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Moreover, the
        child is thus gradually trained to understand that <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good</span></em> and
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">evil</span></em> are to be regarded in two
        relations. Any thing and every thing is called <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good</span></em> when
        it in any way gives enjoyment to any being.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But if the good
        can be secured only by sacrificing a greater good or by inflicting a
        greater evil, then, in this relation, the good is called evil and
        wrong. Thus, in one relation eating a delicious fruit is a good,
        because it gives enjoyment. But if such is the state of <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page067">[pg 067]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> a child's stomach, that sickness and
        suffering will follow the act, then it is evil and wrong.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The early training
        of infancy introduces the first part of the great <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">law of
        sacrifice</span></em> in regard to <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">self</span></em>
        alone. But as the intellect develops, the existence of other minds is
        learned, and their happiness or suffering become subjects of
        attention. Here the calculations of the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">balance</span></em>
        of good and evil become more and more complicated. And the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two
        relations</span></em> also become more definite and extensive.
        Whatever gives pleasure is always called <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good</span></em> and
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">right</span></em>, until some evil is discovered
        as connected with it, not alone or chiefly to self, but to others
        also. Then the compound result is sought for, and if it is seen that,
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">on the
        whole</span></em>, what by itself would be good and right if
        dissevered from its connected evil, does involve <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">more</span></em> evil
        than good, then it is called evil and wrong. But if the balance shows
        so great an amount of good as pays for certain incidental evils, then
        the result is called good and right.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The child also
        very early learns that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">character</span></em> of those around is
        estimated by their reference to this mode of regarding good and evil,
        right and wrong. If a child simply seeks good to itself without any
        regard to the amount of evil involved as a consequence, he is called
        a bad child. On the contrary, those who make sacrifice of their
        wishes and plans to avoid what would bring evil on others, are called
        good, generous, lovely and virtuous. The youngest child soon
        perceives that its mother and other friends are constantly making
        sacrifices for its own good, and bearing inconveniences and trouble
        for the good of those around. And those who perform such acts of
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg 068]</span><a name="Pg068"
        id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> benevolent self-sacrifice are
        praised, and their conduct is called good and right.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus arises a
        conviction or belief that the design or end for which every thing
        exists is to make <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">the most</span></em> happiness possible, and
        that those who conform to this design are acting right, while those
        who do not are acting wrong. Eventually there is established this
        conviction, also, that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">voluntary sacrifice of
        self-enjoyment</span></em> to promote the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">best</span></em> good
        of all, is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">highest</span></em> kind of right action, and
        that those who practice this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">the most</span></em> are the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">best in
        character</span></em>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first feature
        of our moral sense, then, is, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">that impression of the great design of all
        things</span></em> which enables us to judge of the right and wrong
        in voluntary action. This also may be placed as one of the principles
        of common sense. God has so formed our minds and their circumstances,
        that the result is a universal <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">belief</span></em> in every rational mind that
        whatever secures the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">most</span></em> happiness with the least evil
        is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">right</span></em>, and whatever does not is
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">wrong</span></em>. The wanton and needless
        destruction of happiness also men believe to be wrong. Their only
        diversities of opinion are in regard to what will be <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">best</span></em> and
        what will not.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second feature
        of our moral constitution is what is ordinarily called the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sense of
        justice</span></em>. It is that susceptibility which is excited at
        the view of the conduct of others as <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">voluntary</span></em>
        causes of good or evil.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In all cases where
        free agents act to promote happiness, an emotion of approval arises,
        together with a desire of reward to the author of the good. On the
        contrary, when there is a voluntary destruction of happiness, there
        is an emotion of disapproval, and a desire for retributive pain on
        the author of the wrong.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page069">[pg
        069]</span><a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These emotions are
        instinctive, and not at all regulated by reason in their inception.
        When an evil is done, an instant desire is felt <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to discover the
        cause</span></em>; and when it is found, an instant desire is felt
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to inflict
        some penalty</span></em>. So irrational is this impulse, that
        children will exhibit anger and deal blows on inanimate objects that
        cause pain. Even mature minds are sometimes conscious of this
        impulse.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That this impulse
        is an implanted part of our constitution, and not the result of
        instruction, is seen in the delight manifested by young children in
        the narration of the nursery tale where the cruel uncle who murdered
        the Babes in the Wood receives the retributions of Heaven.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is the office
        of the intellect to judge whether the deed was a voluntary one,
        whether the agent intended the mischief, and whether a penalty will
        be of any use. The impulse to punish is never preceded by any such
        calculations.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another feature in
        this sense of justice is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">proportion</span></em> demanded between the evil
        done and the penalty inflicted. That this also is instinctive, and
        not the result of instruction, is seen in the nursery, where children
        will approve of slight penalties for slight offenses, and severe ones
        for great ones, but will revolt from any very great disproportion
        between the wrong act and its penalty. As a general rule, both in the
        nursery and in mature minds, the greater the wrong done, the stronger
        the desire for a penalty, and the more severe the punishment
        demanded.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another very
        important point of consideration is the universal feeling of mankind
        that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">natural penalties</span></em> for wrong-doing
        are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not
        sufficient</span></em>, and that it is an act <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page070">[pg 070]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of love as well as of justice to add to
        these penalties. Thus the parent who forbids his child to eat green
        fruit will not trust to the results of the natural penalty, but will
        restrain by the fear of the immediate and more easily conceived
        penalty of chastisement.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So, in the great
        family of man, the natural penalties for theft are not deemed
        sufficient, but severe penalties for the protection of property are
        added.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This particular is
        the foundation of certain distinctions that are of great importance,
        which will now be pointed out.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We find the terms
        <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">reward</span></em> and <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">punishment</span></em>”</span> used in two
        different relations. In the first and widest sense they signify not
        only the penalties of human law, but those <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">natural
        consequences</span></em> which, by the constitution of nature,
        inevitably follow certain courses of conduct.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus an indolent
        man is said to receive poverty as a punishment, and it is in this
        sense that his children are said to be punished for the faults of
        their father.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The violations of
        natural law are punished without any reference to the question
        whether the evil-doer intended the wrong, or whether he sinned in
        ignorance, or whether this ignorance was involuntary and unavoidable.
        The question of the justice or injustice of such natural penalties
        involves the great question of the right and wrong of the system of
        the universe. Is it just and right for the Creator to make a system
        in which all free agents shall be thus led to obedience to its laws
        by penalties as well as rewards, by fear as well as by hope? This
        question will not be discussed here.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Most discussions
        as to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">just</span></em> rewards and penalties
        ordinarily relate to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">added</span></em> penalties by which parents,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg 071]</span><a name="Pg071"
        id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> teachers and magistrates
        enforce obedience to natural or to statute law.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In these questions
        reference is always had to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">probable results</span></em> of such rewards and
        penalties in securing obedience. If experience has shown that certain
        penalties do secure obedience to wise and good laws, either of nature
        or of human enactment, then they are considered just. If they do not,
        they are counted unwise and unjust.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So, if certain
        penalties are needlessly severe—that is to say, if a less penalty
        will secure equal obedience, then this also decides so severe a
        penalty to be unjust.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In deciding on the
        rectitude of the penalties of human enactments, it is always assumed
        to be unjust to punish for any lack of knowledge and obedience when
        the subject had <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">no power</span></em> to know and to obey. If
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a choice to
        obey</span></em> will not secure the act required of a free agent,
        then a penalty inflicted for disobedience is always regarded as
        unjust. The only seeming exception to this is the case where a
        person, by voluntary means, has deprived himself of ability to obey.
        But in such cases the punishment is felt to be right, not because he
        does not obey when he has no power, but because he has voluntarily
        deprived himself of this power. And he is punished for destroying his
        ability to obey, and not for violating the law.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These things in
        human laws, then, are always demanded to make a penalty appear
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">just</span></em> to the moral sense of mankind,
        namely, that the subject have power to obey, and that he has
        opportunity to know the law, and is not ignorant by any voluntary and
        improper neglect.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In all questions
        of justice, therefore, it is important <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page072">[pg 072]</span><a name="Pg072" id="Pg072" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> to discriminate between those penalties that
        are inherent as a part of the great system of the universe, and for
        which the Creator alone is responsible, and those additional
        penalties which result from voluntary institutions of which men are
        the authors.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next feature
        in our moral constitution is the susceptibility which is excited by
        the intellectual judgment of our own feelings and conduct as either
        right or wrong.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In case we decide
        them to be right, we experience an emotion of self-approval which is
        very delightful; but if we decide that they are wrong, we experience
        an immediate penalty in a painful emotion called <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">remorse</span></em>.
        This emotion is always proportioned to the amount of evil done, and
        the consciousness that it was done knowingly and intentionally. No
        suffering is more keen than the highest emotions of this kind, while
        their pangs are often enduring and unappeasable. Sometimes there is
        an attending desire to inflict retribution on one's self as a mode of
        alleviating this distress.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This
        susceptibility is usually denominated <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">conscience</span></em>. Sometimes this word is
        used to include both the intellectual judgment of our conduct as
        right or wrong, and the consequent emotions of approval or remorse;
        sometimes it refers to the susceptibility alone. Either use is
        correct, as in the connection in which it is employed the distinction
        can ordinarily be easily made.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This analysis of
        our moral constitution furnishes means for a clear definition of such
        terms as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">obligated</span></em>, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ought</span></em>,
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ought
        not</span></em>, and the like.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A person is
        obligated or ought to do a thing when he has the intellect to
        perceive what is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">best</span></em>, and thus <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page073">[pg 073]</span><a name="Pg073" id="Pg073"

        "font-style: italic">right</span></em>, and the moral
        susceptibilities just described. When he is destitute either of the
        intellect or of these susceptibilities, he ceases to be a moral and
        accountable being. He can no longer be made to feel any moral
        obligations.</p>

          that desires for good are measured as to their strength or
          feebleness by our own consciousness, and that in multitudes of
          cases we choose those things which excite <em class=

          strongest</span></em> desire. A mind so constituted as never to be
          able to choose any thing but that which excites the strongest
          desire, would be entirely dependent on circumstances, and thus the
          helpless sport of chance. This is the kind of free agency which
          belongs to the brutes, and may properly be called <em class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In contrast with
          the above, we have already described the mind of man as possessing
          the power to choose <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When there is
          nothing to excite desires, there is no power at all to choose; so
          that motives are as indispensable to the action of the will as
          physical causes are to the movement of matter. The more strongly
          desire is excited the more the power of choice is increased. This
          gives rise to the universal use of language which characterizes
          motives as stronger or weaker according as desire is more or less
          powerful.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The greater part
          of our choices are for things which are <em class=

          so that there is no conflict between what excites the strongest
          desire and what is best for all. Thus to eat, drink, walk, sleep
          and perform most of the daily duties of life, are cases where the
          strongest desire and what is best coincide. In all such cases we
          choose that which excites the strongest desire. And when we assign
          the cause or reason for our choice, we say it was the strongest

          "font-style: italic">occasional</span></em> cause of our choice.
          But our own mind is the only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">producing</span></em> cause of its own
          volitions.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This exhibits
          the grand principle of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">free agency</span></em> in distinction from
          its opposite, which is called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">fatalism</span></em>, viz.:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Motives are producing
          causes of desire, and are occasional causes of choice. Mind itself
          is the only producing cause of choice, having power to choose
          either that which excites the strongest desire or that which reason
          and conscience decide to be best for all
          concerned.</span></span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In opposition to
          this, the fatalist maintains that every act of choice follows the
          strongest desire, so that there is the same <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">invariable</span></em> antecedence and
          sequence <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg
          075]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          between the two as there is in material changes between the
          necessary cause and effect. This being so, the mind has no power to
          choose any thing but that which excites the strongest desire.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, this is a
          question which every person, learned or unlearned, can decide. Have
          we power to choose any other way than as we do choose? Here it is
          claimed that every human being <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">believes</span></em>
          that we have this power, and proves that he believes it by word and
          action. And if any person were habitually to talk and act as if he
          believed children and men had no power to choose right when they
          choose wrong, he would be regarded as having lost his reason.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This, therefore,
          is placed as one of the principles of common sense, viz.,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">every
          rational mind has power to choose either that which excites the
          strongest desire or that which the intellect decides to be best,
          even when it does not excite the strongest
          desire</span></span>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Moral
          power</span></em> is the power to control rational minds by
          motives.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When no desire
          for any good and no fear of any evil exists, the mind has no power
          to choose. Excited desires (or motives) are as indispensable to
          choice as physical causes are to any change in matter.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The stronger the
          desire for a thing, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">easier</span></em> it is to choose it; and the
          less desire there is for a given thing, the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">harder</span></em>
          it is to choose it. This measuring of various degrees of power to
          choose, is a matter of consciousness to every mind, and it is
          recognized in all languages. And we find that all mankind, of all
          languages, recognize the fact that men have power to choose what is
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">best</span></em>, even when it conflicts with
          the strongest desire; so much so, that life itself has been
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page076">[pg 076]</span><a name=
          "Pg076" id="Pg076" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> relinquished for the
          good of others, when there was little or no expectation of a future
          life, or of any consequent good to self.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Moreover, it
          will be shown in a future chapter that our <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">highest</span></em>
          idea of virtue implies a conflict between the strongest desire and
          the conviction of what is right and best on the whole; so that
          sometimes men choose what is seen to be wrong and yet excites the
          strongest desire, and at other times what is right or best, when it
          does not excite the strongest desire.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All
          self-control, self-denial and self-government involve the idea of a
          conflict between the decisions of reason and conscience as to what
          is best and right, and the importunities of the strongest desire
          for what is not so.</p>

          Purposes.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is a
          constant succession of selections to be made between different
          modes of securing happiness. A lesser good is given up for a
          greater, or some good relinquished altogether to avoid some
          consequent pain. Often, also, some evil is sought as the means of
          securing some future good, or of avoiding some greater evil. Thus
          men endure want, fatigue and famine to purchase wealth. Thus the
          nauseous draught will be swallowed to avoid the pains of sickness;
          and thus the pleasures of domestic affection will be sacrificed to
          obtain honor and fame. The whole course of life is a constant
          succession of such decisions between different modes of securing
          happiness and of avoiding pain.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In noticing the
          operation of mind, it will be seen that there is a foundation for
          two classes of volitions <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page077">[pg
          077]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          or acts of choice, which may be denominated <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">subordinate</span></em> and <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">general
          purposes</span></em>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subordinate
          purpose</span></em> is one that secures some particular act, such
          as the moving of the arm or turning of the head. Such volitions are
          ordinarily consequent on some more general purpose of the mind,
          which they aid in accomplishing, and which is, therefore,
          denominated a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">general</span></em> or <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">generic
          purpose</span></em>. For example, a man chooses to make a certain
          journey: this is the general purpose, and, in order to carry it
          out, he performs a great variety of acts, each one of which aids in
          carrying out the generic decision.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It can be seen
          that the general purposes may themselves become subordinate to a
          still more comprehensive purpose. Thus the man may decide to make a
          journey, which is a generic choice in reference to all acts
          subordinate to this end. But this journey may be a subordinate part
          of a more general purpose to make a fortune, or to secure some
          other important end.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is frequently
          the case that a generic purpose, which relates to objects that
          require a long time and many complicated operations, exists when
          the mind seems almost unconscious of its power. For example, a man
          may form a generic purpose to enter a profession for which years
          will be required to prepare. And while his whole course of action
          is regulated by this decision, he engages in pursuits entirely
          foreign to it, and which seem to engross his whole attention. These
          pursuits may sometimes be such as are antagonistic to his grand
          purpose, so as at least to imperil or retard its accomplishment.
          And yet this strong and quiet purpose remains, and is eventually
          carried out.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is the case,
          also, that a generic choice may be <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page078">[pg 078]</span><a name="Pg078" id="Pg078" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> formed to be carried out at some particular
          time and place, and then the mind becomes entirely unconscious of
          it till the appointed period and circumstances occur. Then the
          decision becomes dominant, and controls all other purposes. Thus a
          man may decide that, at a specified hour, he will stop his studies
          and perform certain gymnastic exercises. This volition is forgotten
          until the hour arrives, and then it recurs and is carried out.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This phenomenon
          sometimes occurs in sleep. Some persons, in watching with the sick,
          will determine to wake at given hours to administer medicines; then
          they will sleep soundly till the appointed time comes, when they
          will waken and perform the predetermined actions.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In regard to the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">commencement</span></em> of a generic purpose,
          we find that sometimes it is so distinct and definite as to be the
          subject of consciousness and memory. For example, a spendthrift, in
          some moment of suffering and despondency, may form a determination
          to commence a systematic course of thrift and economy, and may
          actually carry it out through all his future life. Such cases are
          often to be found on record or in every-day life.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In other cases,
          this quiet, hidden, but controlling purpose seems to be formed by
          unconscious and imperceptible influences, so that the mind can not
          revert to the specific time or manner when it originated. For
          example, a child who is trained from early life to speak the truth,
          can never revert to any particular moment when this generic purpose
          originated.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is sometimes
          the case, also, that a person will contemplate some generic purpose
          before it occurs, while <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page079">[pg
          079]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the process of its final formation seems almost beyond the power of
          scrutiny. For example, a man may be urged to relinquish one
          employment and engage in another. He reflects, consults, and is
          entirely uncertain how he shall decide. As time passes, he
          gradually inclines toward the proposed change, until, finally, he
          finds his determination fixed, he scarcely knows when or how.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus it appears
          that generic purposes commence sometimes so instantaneously and
          obviously that the time and influences connected with them can be
          recognized. In other cases, the decision seems to be a gradual one,
          while in some instances the process can be traced, and in others it
          is entirely unnoticed or forgotten.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is in
          reference to such generic purposes that the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">moral
          character</span></em> of men is estimated. An honest man is one who
          has a fixed purpose to act honestly in all circumstances. A
          truthful man is one who has such a purpose to speak the truth at
          all times.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In such cases,
          the degree in which such a purpose controls all others is the
          measure of a man's moral character in the estimate of society.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The history of
          mankind shows a great diversity of moral character dependent on
          such generic choices. Some men possess firm and reliable moral
          principles in certain directions, while they are very destitute of
          them in others.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus it will be
          seen that some have formed a very decided purpose in regard to
          honesty in business affairs, who yet are miserable victims to
          intemperance. Others have cultivated a principle called <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">honor</span></em>,
          that restrains them from certain actions regarded as mean,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page080">[pg 080]</span><a name=
          "Pg080" id="Pg080" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and yet they may be
          frequenters of gambling saloons and other haunts of vice.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the religions
          world, too, it is the case that some who are very firm and decided
          on all points of religious observances and in the cultivation of
          devotional emotions, are guilty of very mean actions, such as some
          worldly men of honor would not practice at the sacrifice of a right
          hand.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The most
          important of all the voluntary phenomena is the fact that, while
          there can be a multitude of these quiet and hidden generic purposes
          in the mind, it is also possible to form <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>
          which shall be the dominant or controlling one, to which all the
          others, both generic and specific, shall become subordinate. In
          common parlance this would be called the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ruling
          passion</span></em>. It is also called the <em class=

          consists in the permanent choice of some one mode of securing
          happiness as the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">chief end</span></em> or grand object of
          life.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is a great
          variety of sources of happiness and of suffering to the human mind.
          Now in the history of our race we find that each one of these modes
          of enjoyment has been selected by different individuals as the
          chief end of their existence—as the mode of seeking enjoyment to
          which they sacrifice every other. Some persons have chosen the
          pleasures of eating, drinking, and the other grosser enjoyments of
          sense. Others have chosen those more elevated and refined pleasures
          that come indirectly from the senses in the emotions of taste.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Others have
          devoted themselves to intellectual enjoyments <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> as their chief resource for happiness.
          Others have selected the exercise of physical and moral power, as
          in the case of conquerors and physical heroes, or of those who have
          sought to control by moral power, as rulers and statesmen.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Others have made
          the attainment of the esteem, admiration, and love of their
          fellow-creatures, their chief end. Others, still, have devoted
          themselves to the promotion of happiness around them as their chief
          interest. Others have devoted themselves to the service of God, or
          what they conceived to be such, and sometimes by the most miserable
          life of asceticism and self-torture.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Others have made
          it their main object in life to obey the laws of rectitude and
          virtue.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In all these
          cases, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">moral character</span></em> of the person, in
          the view of all observers, has been decided by this dominant
          volition, and exactly in proportion to the supremacy with which it
          has <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">actually controlled</span></em> all other
          purposes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some minds seem
          to have no <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">chief</span></em> end of life. Their existence
          is a succession of small purposes, each of which has its turn in
          controlling the life. Others have a strong, defined and
          all-controlling principle.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now experience
          shows that both of these classes are capable, the one of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">forming</span></em>
          and the other of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">changing</span></em> such a purpose. For
          example, in a time of peace and ease there is little to excite the
          mind strongly; but let a crisis come, where fortune, reputation,
          and life are at stake, and men and women are obliged to form
          generic decisions involving all they hold dear, and many minds that
          have no controlling purpose immediately originate one, while those
          whose former ruling <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page082">[pg

          aims were in one direction change them entirely to another.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This shows how
          it is that days of peril create heroes, statesmen and strong men
          and women. The hour of danger calls all the energies of the soul
          into action. Great purposes are formed with the strongest desire
          and emotion. Instantly the whole current of thought, and all the
          coexisting desires and emotions, are conformed to these
          purposes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The experience
          of mankind proves that a dominant generic purpose may <em class=

          <span style="font-size: 144%">How the Thoughts, Desires and
          Emotions are controlled by the Will.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We will now
          consider some of the modes by which the will controls the thoughts,
          desires and emotions.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have seen, in
          previous pages, the influence which desire and emotion exert in
          making both our perceptions and conceptions more vivid. Whatever
          purpose or aim in life becomes an object of strong desire, is
          always distinctly and vividly conceived, while all less interesting
          objects are more faint and indistinct.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have also
          seen that whenever any conception arises it always brings connected
          objects, forming a new and complex picture.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whenever the
          mind is under the influence of a controlling purpose, the object of
          pursuit is always <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">more interesting</span></em> than any other.
          This interest always fastens on those particulars in any mental
          combination that are connected with the ruling purpose and seem
          fitted to promote it, making them more vivid. Around these selected
          objects their past associated ideas begin <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page083">[pg 083]</span><a name="Pg083" id="Pg083" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> to cluster, forming other complex pictures.
          In all these combinations, those ideas most consonant with the
          leading interest of the mind become most vivid, and the others fade
          away.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The grand
          method, then, for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">regulating the thoughts</span></em> is by the
          generic decisions of the mind as to the modes of seeking
          enjoyment.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In regard to the
          power of the mind over its own <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">desires and
          emotions</span></em>, it is very clear that these sensibilities can
          not be regulated by direct specific volitions. Let any person try
          to produce love, fear, joy, hope or gratitude by simply choosing to
          have them arise, and it is soon perceived that no such power
          exists.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But there are
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">indirect</span></em> modes by which the mind
          can control its susceptibilities. The first method is by directing
          attention to those objects of thought which are fitted to call
          forth such emotions. For example, if we wish to awaken the emotion
          of fear, we can place ourselves in circumstances of danger, or call
          up ideas of horror and distress. If we wish to call forth emotions
          of gratitude, we can direct attention to acts of kindness to
          ourselves calculated to awaken such feelings. If we wish to excite
          desire for any object, we can direct attention to those qualities
          in that object that are calculated to excite desire. In all these
          cases the mind can, by an act of will, <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">direct its
          attention</span></em> to subjects calculated to excite emotion and
          desire.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The other mode
          of regulating the desires and emotions is by <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the direction of
          our generic volitions</span></em>. For example, let a man of
          business, who has never had any interest in commerce, decide to
          invest all his property in foreign trade. As soon as this is done,
          the name of the ship that bears his all can never be heard
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page084">[pg 084]</span><a name=
          "Pg084" id="Pg084" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> or seen but it
          excites some emotion. A storm, that before would go unnoticed,
          awakens fear; the prices in the commercial markets, before
          unheeded, now awaken fear or afford pleasure. And thus multitudes
          of varied desires and emotions are called into existence by this
          one generic volition.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One result of a
          purpose to deny an importunate propensity is frequently seen in the
          immediate or gradual diminution of that desire. For example, if a
          person is satisfied that a certain article of food is injurious and
          resolves on <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">total abstinence</span></em>, it will be found
          that the desire for it is very much reduced, far more so than when
          the effort is to diminish the indulgence.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When a generic
          purpose is formed that involves great interests, it is impossible
          to prevent the desires and emotions from running consonant with
          this purpose. The only mode of changing this current is to give up
          this generic purpose and form another. Thus, if a man has devoted
          his whole time and energies to money-making, it is impossible for
          him to prevent his thoughts and feelings from running in that
          direction. He must give up this as his chief end, and take a nobler
          object, if he would elevate the whole course of his mental
          action.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These are the
          principal phenomena of the grand mental faculty which is the
          controlling power of the mind, and on the regulation of which all
          its other powers are dependent.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature of
          regeneration</span></em>, and the question whether it is
          instantaneous or gradual or both, all are intimately connected with
          the subject of this chapter.</p>

        <span style="font-size: 173%">Chapter XVI. Constitutional Varieties
        of the Human Mind.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the preceding
        chapters have been presented the most important mental faculties
        which are common to the race. There are none of the powers and
        attributes of the mind as yet set forth which do not belong to every
        mind which is regarded as rational and complete.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But, though all
        the race have these in common, yet we can not but observe an almost
        endless variety of human character, resulting from the diverse
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">proportions</span></em> and <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">combinations</span></em> of these several
        faculties.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These
        constitutional differences may be noticed, first, in regard to the
        intellectual powers. Some minds are naturally predisposed to exercise
        the reasoning powers. Others, with precisely the same kind of
        culture, have little relish for this, and little power of
        appreciating an argument.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In other cases,
        the imagination seems to be the predominating faculty. In other minds
        there seems to be an equal balance of faculties, so that no
        particular power predominates.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next we see the
        same variety in reference to the susceptibilities. In some minds, the
        desire for love and admiration is the predominating principle. In
        others, the love of power takes the lead. Some are eminently
        sympathizing. Others have a strong love of rectitude, or natural
        conscience. In some, the principle of justice predominates. In
        others, benevolence is the leading impulse.</p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg 086]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Finally, in regard
        to the power of volition, as has been before indicated, there are
        some that possess a strong will that is decisive and effective in
        regulating all specific volitions, while others possess various and
        humbler measures of this power.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to the
        science of Phrenology, some of these peculiarities of mind are
        indicated by the size and shape of different portions of the brain,
        and externally indicated on the skull.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That these
        differences are constitutional, and not the result of education, is
        clear from the many facts showing that no degree of care or training
        will serve to efface these distinctive traits of the mind. To a
        certain degree they may be modified by education, and the equal
        balance of the faculties be promoted, but never to such a degree as
        to efface very marked peculiarities.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In addition to the
        endless diversities that result from these varied proportions and
        combinations, there is a manifest variety in the grades of mind. Some
        races are much lower in the scale of being every way than others,
        while the same disparity exists in individuals of the same race.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The wisdom and
        benevolence of this arrangement is very manifest when viewed in
        reference to the interests of a commonwealth. Where some must lead
        and others follow, it is well that some have the love of power
        strong, and others have it less. Where some must be rulers, to
        inflict penalties as well as to apportion rewards, it is well that
        there be some who have the sense of justice as a leading principle.
        And so in the developments of intellect. Some men are to follow
        callings where the reasoning powers are most needed. Others are to
        adopt pursuits in which taste <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page087">[pg 087]</span><a name="Pg087" id="Pg087" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> and imagination are chiefly required; and thus
        the varied proportions of these faculties become serviceable.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And if it be true
        that the exercise of the social and moral faculties secures the
        highest degree of enjoyment, those disparities in mental powers which
        give exercise to the virtues of compassion, self-denial, fortitude
        and benevolence in serving the weak, and the corresponding exercises
        of gratitude, reverence, humility and devotion in those who are thus
        benefited, then we can see the wisdom and benevolence of this
        gradation of mental capacity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Moreover, in a
        commonwealth perfectly organized, where the happiness of the whole
        becomes that of each part, whatever tends to the highest general good
        tends to the best interest of each individual member. This being so,
        the lowest and humblest in the scale of being, in his appropriate
        place, is happier than he could be by any other arrangement, and
        happier than he could be if all were equally endowed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This subject is
        very important, because some theologians present these disparities of
        mental organization as indications of the depravity consequent on
        Adam's sin.</p>

        Mind.—Habit.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This chapter is
        introduced because some theologians claim that the depravity of man
        consists either in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">a habit</span></em> or in something <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">like</span></em> a
        habit.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page088">[pg
        088]</span><a name="Pg088" id="Pg088" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Habit is a
        facility in performing physical or mental operations, gained by the
        repetition of such acts. As examples of this in <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">physical</span></em>
        operations may be mentioned the power of walking, which is acquired
        only by a multitude of experiments; the power of speech, secured by a
        slow process of repeated acts of imitation; and the power of writing,
        gained in the same way. Success in every pursuit of life is attained
        by oft-repeated attempts, which finally induce a habit.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As examples of the
        formation of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">intellectual</span></em> habits, may be
        mentioned the facility gained in acquiring knowledge by means of
        repeated efforts, and the accuracy and speed with which the process
        of reasoning is performed after long practice in this art.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As examples of
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">moral</span></em> habits may be mentioned those
        which are formed by the oft-repeated exercise of self-government,
        justice, veracity, obedience, and industry. The will, as has been
        shown, gains a facility in controlling specific volitions and in
        yielding obedience to the laws of right action by constant use, as
        really as do all the other mental powers.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The happiness of
        man, in the present state of existence, depends not so much upon the
        circumstances in which he is placed, or the capacities with which he
        is endowed, as upon the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">formation of his habits</span></em>. A man might
        have the organ of sight, and be surrounded with all the beauties of
        nature, and yet, if he did not form the habit of judging of the form,
        distance and size of bodies, most of the pleasure and use from this
        sense would be wanting. The world and all its beauties would be a
        mere confused mass of colors.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the habits of
        walking and of speech were not acquired, these faculties and the
        circumstances for employing <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page089">[pg
        089]</span><a name="Pg089" id="Pg089" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        them would not furnish the enjoyment they were designed to
        secure.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is also the
        formation of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">intellectual</span></em> habits by mental
        discipline and study, which opens vast resources for enjoyment that
        otherwise would be for ever closed. And it is by practicing obedience
        to parents that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">moral</span></em> habits of subordination are
        formed, which are indispensable to our happiness as citizens, and as
        subjects of government. There is no enjoyment which can be pointed
        out, which is not, to a greater or less extent, dependent upon this
        principle.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The influence of
        habit in regard to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">law of sacrifice</span></em> is especially
        interesting. The experience of multitudes of our race shows that such
        tastes and habits may be formed in obeying this law, that what was
        once difficult and painful becomes easy and pleasant.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But this ability
        to secure enjoyment through habits of self-control and self-denial,
        induced by long practice, so far as experience shows, could never be
        secured by any other method.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That the highest
        kinds of happiness are to be purchased by more or less <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">voluntary
        sacrifice</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">suffering</span></em> to procure good for
        others, seems to be a part of that nature of things which we at least
        may suppose has existed from eternity. We can conceive of the eternal
        First Cause only as we imagine a mind on the same pattern as our own
        in constitutional capacities, but indefinitely enlarged in extent and
        action. Knowledge, wisdom, power, justice, benevolence and rectitude,
        must be the same in the Creator as in ourselves, at least so far as
        we can conceive; and, as the practice of self-sacrifice and suffering
        for the good of others is our highest conception of virtue, it is
        impossible to regard <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page090">[pg
        090]</span><a name="Pg090" id="Pg090" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the
        Eternal Mind as all-perfect without involving this idea.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The formation of
        the habits depends chiefly upon the leading desire or governing
        purpose, because whatever the mind desires the most it will
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">act</span></em> the most to secure, and thus by
        repeated acts will form its habits. The <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">character</span></em>
        of every individual, therefore, as before indicated, depends upon the
        mode of seeking happiness selected by the will. Thus the ambitious
        man has selected the attainment of power and admiration as his
        leading purpose, and whatever modes of enjoyment interfere with this
        are sacrificed. The sensual man seeks his happiness from the various
        gratifications of sense, and sacrifices other modes of enjoyment that
        interfere with this. The man devoted to intellectual pursuits, and to
        seeking reputation and influence through this medium, sacrifices
        other modes of enjoyment to secure this gratification. The man who
        has devoted his affections and the service of his life to God and the
        good of his fellow-men, sacrifices all other enjoyments to secure
        that which results from the fulfillment of such obligations. Thus a
        person is an ambitious man, a sensual man, a man of literary
        ambition, or a man of piety and benevolence, according to the
        governing purpose or leading choice of his mind.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is one fact
        in regard to the choice of the leading object of desire, or the
        governing purpose of life, which is very important. Certain modes of
        enjoyment, in consequence of repetition, increase the desire, but
        lessen the capacity of happiness from this source; while, in regard
        to others, gratification increases the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page091">[pg 091]</span><a name="Pg091" id="Pg091" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> desire, and at the same time increases the
        capacity for enjoyment.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The enjoyments
        through the senses are of the first kind. It will be found, as a
        matter of universal experience, that where this has been chosen as
        the main purpose of life, though the desire for such pleasures is
        continually increased, yet, owing to the physical effects of
        excessive indulgence, the capacity for enjoyment is decreased. Thus
        the man who so degrades his nature as to make the pleasures of eating
        and drinking the great pursuit of life, while his desires never
        abate, finds his zest for such enjoyments continually decreasing, and
        a perpetual need for new devices to stimulate appetite and awaken the
        dormant capacities. The pleasures of sense always pall from
        repetition—grow <span class="tei tei-q">“stale, flat and
        unprofitable,”</span> though the deluded being who has thus slavishly
        yielded to such appetites feels himself bound by chains of habit,
        which, even when enjoyment ceases, seldom are broken.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The pleasures
        derived from the exercise of power, when its attainment becomes the
        master passion, are also of this description. The statesman, the
        politician, the conqueror, are all seeking for this, and desire never
        abates while any thing of the kind remains to be attained. We do not
        find that enjoyment increases in proportion as power is secured. On
        the contrary, it seems to cloy in possession. Alexander, the
        conqueror of the world, when he had gained <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em>, wept
        that objects of desire were extinct, and that possession could not
        satisfy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But there are
        other sources of happiness for which the desire ever continues, and
        possession only increases the capacity for enjoyment. Of this class
        is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg 092]</span><a name=
        "Pg092" id="Pg092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the susceptibility of
        happiness from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">giving and receiving affection</span></em>.
        Here, the more there is given and received, the more is the power of
        giving and receiving increased. We find that this principle outlives
        every other, and even the decays of nature itself. When tottering age
        on the borders of the grave is just ready to resign its wasted
        tenement, often from its dissolving ashes the never-dying spark of
        affection has burst forth with new and undiminished luster. This is
        that immortal fountain of happiness always increased by imparting,
        never surcharged by receiving.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another principle,
        which increases both desire and capacity by exercise, is the power of
        enjoyment from being the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">cause of happiness to others</span></em>. Never
        was an instance known of regret for devotion to the happiness of
        others. On the contrary, the more this holy and delightful principle
        is in exercise, the more the desires are increased, and the more are
        the susceptibilities for enjoyment from this source enlarged. While
        the votaries of pleasure are wearing down with the exhaustion of
        abused nature, and the votaries of ambition are sighing over its
        thorny wreath, the benevolent spirit is exulting in the success of
        its plans of good, and reaching forth to still purer and more perfect
        bliss.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This principle is
        especially true in regard to the practice of rectitude. The more the
        leading aim of the mind is devoted to <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">right feeling and
        action</span></em>, or to obedience to all the laws of God, the more
        both the desire and the capacity of enjoyment from this source are
        increased.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But there is
        another fact in regard to habit, which has an immense bearing on the
        well-being of our race. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page093">[pg
        093]</span><a name="Pg093" id="Pg093" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        When a habit of seeking happiness in some one particular mode is once
        formed, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">change</span></em> of this habit becomes
        difficult just in proportion to the degree of repetition which has
        been practiced. A habit once formed, it is no longer an easy matter
        to choose between the mode of securing happiness chosen and another
        which the mind may be led to regard as much superior. Thus, in
        gratifying the appetite, a man may feel that his happiness is
        continually diminishing, and that, by sacrificing this passion, he
        may secure much greater enjoyment from another source; yet the force
        of habit is such, that decisions of the will perpetually yield to its
        power.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, also, if a
        man has found his chief enjoyment in that admiration and applause of
        men so ardently desired, even after it has ceased to charm, and seems
        like emptiness and vanity, still, when nobler objects of pursuit are
        offered, the chains of habit bind him to his wonted path. Though he
        looks and longs for the one that his conscience and his intellect
        assure him is brightest and best, the conflict with bad habit ends in
        fatal defeat and ruin. It is true that every habit can be corrected
        and changed, but nothing requires greater firmness of purpose and
        energy of will; for it is not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">one</span></em> resolution of mind that can
        conquer habit: it must be a constant series of long-continued
        efforts.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The influence of
        habit in reference to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">emotions</span></em> deserves special attention
        as having a direct influence upon character and happiness. All
        pleasurable emotions of mind, being grateful, are indulged and
        cherished, and are not weakened by repetition unless they become
        excessive. If the pleasures of sense are indulged beyond a certain
        extent, the bodily system is <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page094">[pg 094]</span><a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> exhausted, and satiety is the consequence. If
        the love of power and admiration is indulged to excess, so as to
        become the leading purpose of life, they are found to be cloying.
        But, within certain limits, all pleasurable emotions do not seem to
        lessen in power by repetition.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But in regard to
        painful emotions the reverse is true. The mind instinctively resists
        or flies from them, so that often a habit of suppressing such
        emotions is formed, until the susceptibility diminishes, and
        sometimes appears almost entirely destroyed. Thus a person often
        exposed to danger ceases to be troubled by fear, because he forms a
        habit of suppressing it. A person frequently in scenes of distress
        and suffering learns to suppress the emotions of painful sympathy.
        The surgeon is an example of the last case, where, by repeated
        operations, he has learned to suppress emotions until they seldom
        recur. A person inured to guilt gradually deadens the pangs of
        remorse, until the conscience becomes <span class="tei tei-q">“seared
        as with a hot iron.”</span> Thus, also, with the emotion of shame.
        After a person has been repeatedly exposed to contempt, and feels
        that he is universally despised, he grows callous to any such
        emotions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The mode by which
        the mind succeeds in forming such a habit seems to be by that
        implanted principle which makes ideas that are most in consonance
        with the leading desire of the mind become vivid and distinct, while
        those that are less interesting fade away. Now no person desires to
        witness pain except from the hope of relieving it, unless it be that,
        in anger, the mind is sometimes gratified with the infliction of
        suffering. But, in ordinary cases, the sight of suffering
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page095">[pg 095]</span><a name="Pg095"
        id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> is avoided except where relief
        can be administered. In such cases, the desire of administering
        relief becomes the leading one, so that the mind is turned off from
        the view of the suffering to dwell on conceptions of modes of relief.
        Thus the surgeon and physician gradually form such habits that the
        sight of pain and suffering lead the mind to the conception of modes
        of relief, whereas a mind not thus interested dwells on the more
        painful ideas.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The habits of life
        are all formed either from the desire to secure happiness or to avoid
        pain, and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">fear of suffering</span></em> is found to be a
        much more powerful principle than the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">desire of
        happiness</span></em>. The soul flies from pain with all its
        energies, even when it will be inert at the sight of promised joy. As
        an illustration of this, let a person be fully convinced that the
        gift of two new senses would confer as great an additional amount of
        enjoyment as is now secured by the eye and ear, and the promise of
        this future good would not stimulate with half the energy that would
        be caused by the threat of instant and entire blindness and
        deafness.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If, then, the mind
        is stimulated to form good habits and to avoid the formation of evil
        ones most powerfully by painful emotions, when their legitimate
        object is not effected they continually decrease in vividness, and
        the designed benefit is lost. If a man is placed in circumstances of
        danger, and fear leads to habits of caution and carefulness, the
        object of exciting this emotion is accomplished, and the diminution
        of it is attended with no evil. But if fear is continually excited,
        and no such habits are formed, then the susceptibility is lessened,
        while the good to be secured by it <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page096">[pg 096]</span><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> is lost. So, also, with emotions of sympathy.
        If we witness pain and suffering, and it induces habits of active
        devotion to the good of those who suffer, the diminution of the
        susceptibility is a blessing and no evil. But if we simply indulge
        emotions, and do not form the habits they were intended to secure,
        the power of sympathy is weakened, and the designed benefit is lost.
        Thus, again, with shame: if this painful emotion does not lead us to
        form habits of honor and rectitude, it is continually weakened by
        repetition, and the object for which it was bestowed is not secured.
        And so with remorse: if this emotion is awakened without leading to
        habits of benevolence and virtue, it constantly decays in power, and
        the good it would have secured is for ever lost.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It does not
        appear, however, that the power of emotion in the soul is thus
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">destroyed</span></em>. This is evident from the
        fact that the most hardened culprits, when brought to the hour of
        death, where all plans of future good cease to charm the mental eye,
        are often overwhelmed with the most vivid emotions of sorrow, shame,
        remorse and fear. And often, in the course of life, there are seasons
        when the soul returns from its pursuit of deluding visions to commune
        with itself in its own secret chambers. At such seasons, shame,
        remorse and fear take up their abode in their long-deserted dwelling,
        and ply their scorpion whips till they are obeyed, and the course of
        honor and virtue is resumed, or till the distracted spirit again
        flies abroad for comfort and relief.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is a great
        diversity in human character, resulting from the diverse proportions
        and combinations of those powers of mind which the race have in
        common. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page097">[pg 097]</span><a name=
        "Pg097" id="Pg097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> At the same time,
        there is a variety in the scale of being, or relative grade of each
        mind. While all are alike in the common faculties of the human mind,
        some have every faculty on a much larger scale than others, while
        some are of a very humble grade.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The principle of
        habit has very great influence in modifying and changing these
        varieties. Thus, by forming habits of intellectual exercise, a mind
        of naturally humble proportions can be elevated considerably above
        one more highly endowed by natural constitution. So the training of
        some particular intellectual faculty, which by nature is deficient,
        can bring it up nearer to the level of other powers less disciplined
        by exercise.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In like manner,
        the natural susceptibilities can be increased, diminished or modified
        by habit. Certain tastes, that had little power, can be so cultivated
        as to overtop all others.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So of the moral
        nature: it can be so exercised that a habit will be formed which will
        generate a strength and prominency that nature did not impart.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the most
        important results of habit is its influence on <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">faith</span></em> or
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">belief</span></em>. Those persons who practice
        methods of false reasoning, who turn away from evidence and follow
        their feelings in forming opinions, eventually lose the power of
        sure, confiding belief.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the contrary,
        an honest, conscientious steadiness in seeking the truth and in
        yielding to evidence, secures the firmest and most reliable
        convictions, and that peace of mind which alone results from
        believing the truth.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The will itself is
        also subject to this same principle. A strong will, that is trained
        to yield obedience to law <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page098">[pg
        098]</span><a name="Pg098" id="Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in
        early life, acquires an ease and facility in doing it which belongs
        ordinarily to weak minds, and yet can retain all its vigor. And a
        mind that is trained to bring subordinate volitions into strict and
        ready obedience to a generic purpose, acquires an ease and facility
        in doing this which was not a natural endowment.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus it appears
        that by the principle of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">habit</span></em> every mind is furnished with
        the power of elevating itself in the scale of being, and of so
        modifying and perfecting the proportions and combinations of its
        constitutional powers, that often the result is that there is no mode
        of distinguishing between the effects of habit and those of natural
        organization.</p>

        attributes of any mind are the powers and faculties to be exercised,
        while it is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        attributes.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having gained the
        existence of a Great First Cause by the use of one principle of
        common sense, and the fact that this cause is an intelligent mind by
        another, it has been shown that a third of these principles leads to
        the belief that the natural attributes of God are like our own. We
        can not conceive of any other kind of minds than our own, because we
        have never had any past experience or knowledge of any
        other.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page099">[pg
        099]</span><a name="Pg099" id="Pg099" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But while we thus
        conclude that the mind of the Creator is, so far as we can conceive,
        precisely like our own in constitutional organization, we are as
        necessarily led to perceive that the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">extent</span></em> of
        these powers is far beyond our own. A mind with the power, wisdom and
        goodness exhibited in the very small portion of his works submitted
        to our inspection, who has inhabited eternity, and matured through
        everlasting ages—our minds are lost in attempting any conception of
        the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">extent</span></em> of such infinite
        faculties!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus we are
        necessarily led to conceive of the Creator as possessing the
        intellectual powers described in previous pages. He perceives,
        conceives, imagines, judges and remembers just as we do.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So also all our
        varied susceptibilities to pleasure and pain exist in the Eternal
        Mind. The desire of good and the fear of evil which are the motive
        power in the human mind, exist also in the divine. Thus by the light
        of nature we settle the question that the existence of
        susceptibilities to pain and evil are not the results of the
        Creator's will, but are a part of the eternal nature of things which
        he did not originate or control.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All the minds we
        ever knew or heard of are moved to action by desire to gain happiness
        and escape pain, and as we can conceive of no other kind of mind than
        our own, we must attribute to the Creator this foundation element of
        mental activity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus we are led to
        attribute to the Creator all those susceptibilities included in
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the moral
        sense</span></em>, as described in previous pages. His mind, like
        ours, feels that whatever makes <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">the most</span></em> happiness with <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the least</span></em>
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100"

        that is to say, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">it is fitted to the eternal nature of
        things</span></em>, of which his own mind is a part.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So also the
        Creator possesses that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sense of justice</span></em> implanted in our
        own minds, which involves the desire of good to those who make
        happiness, and of evil to those who destroy happiness; and which also
        demands that such retributions be <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">proportioned</span></em> to the good and evil
        done, and to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">power</span></em> of the agent.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So also we must
        conceive of the Creator as possessing the susceptibility of
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">conscience</span></em>, which includes in the
        very constitution of mind retributions for right and wrong
        action.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, we are led
        to conceive of God as a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">rational free agent</span></em>, with power to
        choose either that which excites the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">strongest
        desire</span></em> or that which is perceived to be <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">best on the whole for
        all concerned</span></em>, even if it does not excite the strongest
        desire.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, we are to
        conceive of the Creator as possessing a belief in those principles of
        reason which he has implanted in our minds, and made our guide in all
        matters, both of temporal and religious concern.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, our

        solitude</span></em>, but that there is <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">more than one
        eternal, uncreated mind</span></em>, and that all their powers of
        enjoyment from giving and receiving happiness in social relations
        have been in exercise from eternal ages. This is the just and natural
        deduction of reason and experience, as truly as the deduction that
        there is at least one eternal First Cause.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, all our
        experience of mind involves the idea of the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mutual relation of
        minds</span></em>. We perceive that minds are made to match to other
        minds, so that there <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg
        101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> can
        be no complete action of mind, according to its manifest design,
        except in relation to other beings. A mind can not love till there is
        another mind to call forth such emotion. A mind can not bring a tithe
        of its power into appropriate action except in a community of minds.
        The conception of a solitary being, with all the social powers and
        sympathies of the human mind infinitely enlarged, and yet without any
        sympathizing mind to match and meet them, involves the highest idea
        of unfitness and imperfection conceivable, while it is contrary to
        our uniform experience of the nature and history of mind.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been argued
        that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">unity of design</span></em> in the works of
        nature proves that there is but one creating mind. This is not so,
        for in all our experience of the creations of finite beings no
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">great
        design</span></em> was ever formed without a combination of minds,
        both to plan and to execute. The majority of minds in all ages, both
        heathen and Christian, have always conceived of the Creator as
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in some
        way</span></em> existing so as to involve the ideas of plurality and
        of the love and communion of one mind with another.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And yet the unity
        and harmony of all created things as parts of one and the same
        design, teach <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">a degree</span></em> of unity in the authorship
        of the universe never known in the complex action of finite
        minds.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unity</span></em> and
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">plurality</span></em> in the Creator of all
        things is educed by reason and experience from the works of
        nature.</p>

        Guide to the Moral Attributes of God.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having employed
        the principles of common sense to gain a knowledge of the natural
        attributes of God, we are next to employ the same principles to gain
        his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">moral</span></em> character; or those attributes
        which are exhibited in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">willing</span></em>. In other words, we are to
        seek the character of God as expressed in his <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">works</span></em> or
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">deeds</span></em>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In our experience
        of the moral character of minds in this world, we find that some of
        the highest grades as to intellect and susceptibilities, are lowest
        as to good-willing. How is it, then, with the highest mind of all?
        Does he so prefer evil to good, that he deliberately plans for the
        production of evil when he has power to produce happiness in its
        place? Or does he sometimes prefer evil and sometimes good, with the
        variable humors of the human race? Or does he always prefer good when
        it costs him no trouble or sacrifice, but never when it does? Or is
        he one who <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">invariably</span></em> chooses what is
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">best for
        all</span></em>, even when it involves painful sacrifices to
        himself?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In seeking a reply
        to these momentous questions, we return once more to the principle of
        common sense before stated, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the nature of any
        work or contrivance is proof of the character and design of the
        author</span></em>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In examining the
        works of the Creator, we find that the material world impresses us as
        wisely adjusted and good in construction, only as it is fitted to
        give enjoyment to sentient beings. It is the intelligent,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103"
        id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> feeling, acting minds that
        give the value to every other existence. If there were no minds, all
        perception of beauty, fitness and goodness would perish.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">minds</span></em>,
        therefore, which are the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">chief</span></em> works of the Creator's hand,
        and which give value to all others.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em> of
        these minds is evil, then the author of them is proved to be evil by
        his works. If their nature is good and perfect, then their author is
        proved to be good and perfect.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here again we are
        driven back to our own minds to gain the only conceptions possible to
        us, not only of wisdom, but of goodness or benevolence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On examination, we
        shall find that we can form no idea of these qualities which does not
        involve a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">limitation of power</span></em>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our idea of power
        is that which we gain when we will to move our bodies or to make any
        other change, and this change ensues. Our only idea of a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">want</span></em> of
        power is gained when the choice or willing of a change or event does
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">not</span></em> produce it. Whenever, therefore,
        it shall appear that the Creator wills or wishes a thing to exist or
        to be changed, and that change or existence does not follow his so
        willing, we can not help believing that he has not the power to
        produce it?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again; our idea of
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">perfectness</span></em> always has reference to
        power; for a thing is regarded as perfect in construction only when
        there is no power in God or man to make it <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">better</span></em>.
        When any arrangement is as good as it can be, so that neither God nor
        man has power to make it better, we regard it as <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perfect</span></em>,
        even when there is some degree of evil involved.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We are now
        prepared to define what is included in <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page104">[pg 104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the terms <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">perfect wisdom</span></em> and <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perfect
        benevolence</span></em>, when applied to the Creator or to any other
        being, thus: A perfectly wise being is one who invariably wills the
        best possible ends and the best possible means of accomplishing those
        ends.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An imperfectly
        wise being is one who does not invariably do this.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A perfectly
        benevolent being is one who invariably wills the most good and the
        least evil <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">in his power</span></em>. An imperfectly
        benevolent being is one who does not invariably will thus.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">degree</span></em> in
        which a being is ranked as wise and good is estimated by the extent
        to which his willing good or evil corresponds with his power.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus it appears
        that, in a system where evil exists, the very idea of <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perfect</span></em>
        benevolence and wisdom involves the supposition of a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">limitation of
        power</span></em>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To return, then,
        to the question as proposed at the commencement of the chapter—Is the
        Creator a being who prefers good to evil invariably, or is he one who
        only sometimes prefers evil to good, and at other times prefers good
        to evil, with the varying humors of man; or does he <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">invariably</span></em> choose what is <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">best for
        all</span></em>, even in cases where it may cost personal sacrifice
        and suffering to himself?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will be the
        object of what follows to prove that the last supposition is the true
        one.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In attempting
        this, we again take the principle of common sense, that <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">the nature</span></em> of any contrivance proves
        the design and character of the author.”</span> Then we proceed to a
        review of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">the nature</span></em>, first of mind, and next
        of the material world, to prove that the design or <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">chief end</span></em>
        of the Creator is, not to make happiness <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> irrespective of the amount, but to produce the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">greatest
        possible</span></em> happiness with the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">least
        possible</span></em> evil. In other words, we are to seek for proof
        that God has done all things <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">for the best</span></em>, so that he has no
        power to do better.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In still another
        form, we are to seek for evidence, in <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
        nature</span></em> of God's works, that he has ever done <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the best he
        could</span></em>, so that the amount of evil that ever was or ever
        will exist, is not caused by his <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">willing</span></em>
        it, but by his want of power to prevent it; so that any change would
        be an increase of evil and a lessening of good to the universe as a
        whole.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In pursuing this
        attempt, it will be needful to reproduce two or three chapters of a
        work by the author, already before the public, entitled, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Bible and the
        People; or, Common Sense applied to Religion</span></span>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this work
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the nature
        of mind</span></em> is presented very much more in detail, for the
        same purpose as that here indicated. What will now follow is a brief
        review of previous chapters in that work, as a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">summary</span></em>
        of the evidence there presented that the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">chief end</span></em>
        of God in all his works is to produce the greatest possible happiness
        with the least possible evil.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whenever we find
        any contrivances all combining to secure a certain good result,
        which, at the same time, involve some degree of inevitable evil, and
        then discover that there are contrivances to diminish and avoid this
        evil, we properly infer that the author intended to secure <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as much of the good
        with as little of the evil as possible</span></em>. For example, a
        traveler finds a deserted mine, and all around he discovers
        contrivances for obtaining gold, and, at the same time, other
        contrivances for getting rid of the earth mixed with it. The
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span><a name="Pg106"
        id="Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> inevitable inference would be
        that the author of these contrivances designed to secure as much gold
        with as little earth as possible; and should any one say that he
        could have had more gold and less earth if he chose to, the answer
        would be that there is no evidence of this assertion, but direct
        evidence against it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again: should we
        discover a piece of machinery in which every contrivance tended to
        secure a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">speed</span></em> in movement, produced by the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">friction</span></em> of wheels against a rough
        surface, and at the same time other contrivances were found for
        diminishing all friction that was useless, we should infer that the
        author designed to secure the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">greatest possible speed</span></em> with the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">least
        possible friction</span></em>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In like manner, if
        we can show that mind is a contrivance that acts by the influence of
        fear of evil, and that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">pain</span></em> seems as indispensable to the
        action of a free agent as friction is to motion; if we can show that
        there is no contrivance in mind or matter which is designed to secure
        suffering as its primary end; if we can, on the contrary, show that
        the direct end of all the organizations of mind and matter is to
        produce happiness; if we can show that it is only the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wrong
        action</span></em> of mind that involves most of the pain yet known,
        so that right action, in its place, would secure only happiness; if
        we can show contrivances for diminishing pain, and also contrivances
        for increasing happiness by means of the inevitable pain involved in
        the system of things, then the just conclusion will be gained that
        the Author of the system of mind and matter designed <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“to produce the greatest possible happiness with the
        least possible evil.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page107">[pg 107]</span><a name="Pg107" id="Pg107" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the pages which
        follow, we shall present evidence exhibiting all these
        particulars.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The only way in
        which we learn the nature of a thing is to observe its qualities and
        actions. This is true of mind as much as it is of matter. Experience
        and observation teach that the nature of mind is such, that
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the fear of
        suffering</span></em> is indispensable to secure a large portion of
        the enjoyment within reach of its faculties, and that the highest
        modes of enjoyment can not be secured except by sacrifice, and thus
        by more or less suffering.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This appears to be
        an inevitable combination, as much so as friction is inevitable in
        machinery.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have the
        evidence of our own consciousness that it is fear of evil to
        ourselves or to others that is the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">strongest</span></em>
        motive power to the mind. If we should find that no pain resulted
        from burning up our own bodies, or from drowning, or from any other
        cause; if every one perceived that no care, trouble, or pain resulted
        from losing all kinds of enjoyment, the effort to seek it would be
        greatly diminished.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we could desire
        good enough to exert ourselves to seek it, and yet should feel no
        discomfort in failing; if we could <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lose every
        thing</span></em>, and feel no sense of pain or care, the stimulus to
        action which experience has shown to be most powerful and beneficent
        would be lost.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We find that
        abundance of ease and prosperity enervates mental power, and that
        mind increases in all that is grand and noble, and also in the most
        elevating happiness, by means of danger, care and pain. We may
        properly infer, then, that evil is a necessary part of the experience
        of a perfectly-acting mind.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page108">[pg 108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So strong is the
        conviction that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">painful penalties</span></em> are indispensable,
        that the kindest parents and the most benevolent rulers are the most
        sure to increase rather than diminish those that are already involved
        in the existing nature of things.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again: without a
        revelation we have no knowledge of any kind of mind but by inference
        from our experience in this state of being. All we know of the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Eternal
        First Cause</span></em> is by a process of reasoning, inferring that
        his nature must be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">like</span></em> the only minds of which we have
        any knowledge. We assume, then, that he is a free agent, regulated by
        desire for happiness and fear of evil.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We thus come to
        the conclusion that this organization of mind is a part of the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fixed and
        eternal nature of things</span></em>, and does not result from the
        will of the Creator. His own is the eternal pattern of an all-perfect
        mind, and our own are formed on this perfect model, with
        susceptibilities to pain as an indispensable motive power in gaining
        happiness.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We will now
        recapitulate some of the particulars in the laws and constitution of
        mind which tend to establish the position that its Creator's grand
        design is <span class="tei tei-q">“to produce the greatest possible
        happiness with the least possible evil.”</span></p>

        <div class="tei tei-div" style=
        "margin-top: 4.00em; margin-bottom: 4.00em">

          <span style="font-size: 144%">Intellectual Powers.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">First, then, in
          reference to the earliest exercise of mind in <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sensation</span></em>. The eye might have been
          so made that light would inflict pain, and the ear so that sound
          would cause only discomfort. And so of all the other senses.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the
          condition of a well-formed, healthy infant <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page109">[pg 109]</span><a name="Pg109" id="Pg109" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> is a most striking illustration of the
          adaptation of the senses to receive enjoyment. Who could gaze on
          the countenance of such a little one, as its various senses are
          called into exercise without such a conviction? The delight
          manifested as the light attracts the eye, or as pleasant sounds
          charm the ear, or as the limpid nourishment gratifies its taste, or
          as gentle motion and soft fondlings soothe the nerves of touch, all
          testify to the benevolent design of its Maker.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next come the
          pleasures of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">perception</span></em> as the infant gradually
          observes the qualities of the various objects around, and slowly
          learns to distinguish its mother and its playthings from the
          confused mass of forms and colors. Then comes the gentle curiosity
          as it watches the movement of its own limbs, and finally discovers
          that its own volitions move its tiny fingers, while the grand idea
          that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">it
          is itself a cause</span></em> is gradually introduced.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next come the
          varied intellectual pleasures as the several powers are exercised
          in connection with the animate and material world around, in
          acquiring the meaning of words, and in imitating the sounds and use
          of language. The adult, in toiling over the dry lexicon, little
          realizes the pleasure with which the little one is daily acquiring
          the philosophy, grammar, and vocabulary of its mother tongue.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A child who can
          not understand a single complete sentence, or speak an intelligible
          phrase, will sit and listen with long-continued delight to the
          simple enunciation of words, each one of which presents a picture
          to his mind of a dog, a cat, a cow, a horse, a whip, a ride, and
          many other objects and scenes that have given pleasure in the past;
          while the single words, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg
          110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          without any sentences, bring back, not only vivid conceptions of
          these objects, but a part of the enjoyment with which they have
          been connected.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then, as years
          pass by, the intellect more and more administers pleasure, while
          the reasoning powers are developed, the taste cultivated, the
          imagination exercised, the judgment employed, and the memory stored
          with treasures for future enjoyment.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the proper
          and temperate use of the intellectual powers, there is a constant
          experience of placid satisfaction, or of agreeable and often of
          delightful emotions, while no one of these faculties is productive
          of pain, except in violating the laws of the mental
          constitution.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tei tei-div" style=

          <span style="font-size: 144%">The Susceptibilities.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In regard to the
          second general class of mental powers—<em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
          susceptibilities</span></em>—the first particular to be noticed is
          the ceaseless and all-pervading <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">desire to gain
          happiness and escape pain</span></em>. This is the mainspring of
          all voluntary activity; for no act of volition will take place till
          some good is presented to gain, or some evil to shun. At the same
          time, as has been shown, the desire to escape evil is more potent
          and effective than the desire for good. Thousands of minds that
          rest in passive listlessness, when there is nothing to stimulate
          but hope of enjoyment, will exert every physical and mental power
          to escape impending evil. The seasons of long-continued prosperity
          in nations always tend to a deterioration of intellect and manhood.
          It is in seasons of danger alone that fear wakes up the highest
          energies, and draws forth the heroes of the race.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mind, then, is
          an existence having the power of that <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page111">[pg 111]</span><a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> self-originating action of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">choice</span></em>
          which constitutes free agency, while this power can only be
          exercised when desires are excited to gain happiness or to escape
          pain. This surely is the highest possible evidence that its Author
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">intended</span></em> mind should thus act.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But a mind may
          act to secure happiness and avoid pain to itself, and yet may gain
          only very low grades of enjoyment, while much higher are within
          reach of its faculties. So, also, it may act to gain happiness for
          itself as the chief end in such ways as to prevent or destroy the
          higher happiness of others around.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In reference to
          this, we find those susceptibilities which raise man to the dignity
          of a rational and moral being.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the first
          place, there is that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">impression of the great design</span></em> of
          the Creator existing in every mind, either as a result of
          constitution or of training, or of both united, which results in a
          feeling that whatever lessens or destroys happiness is unfit and
          contrary to the system of things.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next there is
          the power to balance pleasure and pain, and estimate the compound
          result, both in reference to self and to the commonwealth. With
          this is combined the feeling that whatever secures <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
          most</span></em> good with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">the least</span></em> evil is right and fit,
          and that the opposite is wrong and unfitted to the nature of
          things.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next comes the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sense of
          justice</span></em>, which results in an impulse to <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">discover the
          cause</span></em> of good and evil, and when this cause is found to
          be a voluntary agent, a consequent impulse to make returns of good
          for good, and of evil for evil, and also to <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">proportion</span></em> retributive rewards or
          penalties to the amount of good or evil done.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With this, also,
          is combined the feeling that those <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page112">[pg 112]</span><a name="Pg112" id="Pg112" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> retributions should be applied only where
          there was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">voluntary</span></em> power to have done
          otherwise. When it is seen that there was no such power, the
          impulse to reward or punish is repressed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such is the deep
          conviction that such retributions are indispensable, that where
          natural pains and penalties do not avail, others are demanded, both
          in the family and in the commonwealth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lastly, we find
          the susceptibility of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">conscience</span></em>, which, by the very
          framework of the mind itself, apportions the retributive pangs of
          remorse for wrong doing, and the pleasure of self-approval for well
          doing. These, too, are retributions never to be escaped, and the
          most exquisite, both in elevated happiness and excruciating pain.
          The mind carries about in itself its own certain and gracious
          remunerator—its own inexorable prosecutor, judge, and
          executioner.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This same design
          of the Creator may be most delightfully traced in what may be
          called the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">economy</span></em> of happiness and pain.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One particular
          of this is set forth at large in the chapter on the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">emotions of
          taste</span></em>.<a id="noteref_5" name="noteref_5" href=
          "#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a> Here we
          find the mind formed not only to secure multitudinous enjoyment
          through the nerves of sensation, but that, by the principle of
          association, there is a perpetual <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">reproduction</span></em> of these emotions in
          connection with the colors, forms, sounds, and motions with which
          they were originally associated. Thus there are perpetually
          returning emotions of pleasure so recondite, so refined, so
          infinite in variety and extent, and yet how little noticed or
          understood!</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg
          113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another
          indication of the same kind is the peculiarity pointed out on
          former pages, where it is shown that securing certain enjoyments
          which tend to promote the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">general</span></em> happiness increases both
          desire and capacity for enjoyment, while those that terminate in
          the individual diminish by possession. Thus the enjoyment of power,
          which must, from its nature, be confined to a few, diminishes by
          possession. Thus, too, the pleasures of sense pall by indulgence.
          But the enjoyment resulting from the exercise and reciprocation of
          love, and that resulting from benevolent actions, and that which is
          included in a course of perfect obedience to all the rules of
          rectitude, increases the capacity for enjoyment.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another
          illustration of the same principle is exhibited in the chapter on
          Habit, where it is seen that the power of pleasurable emotions
          increases by repetition, while painful emotions decrease when the
          good to be secured by their agency is attained. Thus <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fear</span></em>
          serves to protect from danger till caution and habit reader it
          needless, and then it decreases. And so of other painful
          emotions.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is
          interesting to trace the same design in the constitution of minds
          in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">regard
          to each other</span></em>. We find that the purest and highest kind
          of happiness is dependent on the mutual relations of minds. Thus
          the enjoyment resulting from the discovery of intellectual and
          moral traits in other minds—that resulting from giving and
          receiving affection—that gained by sympathy, and by being the cause
          of happiness to others, and that resulting from conscious
          rectitude, all are dependent on the existence of other beings.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now we find that
          minds are relatively so constituted <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">what one desires, it is a source of happiness
          in another to bestow</span></em>. Thus one can be pleased by the
          discovery of certain traits in other minds, while, in return, the
          exhibition of these traits, and the consciousness that they are
          appreciated, is an equal source of enjoyment. One mind seeks the
          love of others, while these, in return, are desiring objects of
          affection, and rejoice to confer the gift that is sought. The
          desire of knowledge or the gratification of curiosity is another
          source of pleasure, while satisfying this desire is a cause of
          enjoyment to those around. How readily do mankind seize upon every
          opportunity to convey interesting news to other minds!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again: we find
          that, both in sorrow and in joy, the mind seeks for the sympathy of
          others, while this grateful and soothing boon it is delightful to
          bestow. So, also, the consciousness of being the cause of good to
          another sends joy to the heart, while the recipient is filled with
          the pleasing glow of gratitude in receiving the benefit. The
          consciousness of virtue in acting for the general good, instead of
          for contracted, selfish purposes, is another source of happiness,
          while those who witness its delightful results rejoice to behold
          and acknowledge it. What bursts of rapturous applause have followed
          the exhibition of virtuous self-sacrifice for the good of others
          from bosoms who rejoiced in this display, and who could owe this
          pleasure to no other cause than the natural constitution of mind,
          which is formed to be made happy both in beholding and in
          exercising virtue.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This same
          beneficial economy is manifested in a close analysis of all that is
          included in the affections of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">love</span></em> and <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">gratitude</span></em>.</p><span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been
          shown that, in the commencement of existence, the young mind first
          learns the sources of good and evil to self, and its sole motives
          are desire for its own enjoyment.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Soon, however,
          it begins to experience the happiness resulting from the relations
          of minds to each other, and then is developed the superior power of
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">love</span></em>, and its importance as a
          regulating principle.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the analysis
          of this affection, it is seen to consist, first, in the pleasurable
          emotions which arise in view of certain traits of character in
          another mind. When these qualities are discovered, the first result
          is emotions of pleasure in the contemplation. Immediately there
          follows <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          desire of good</span></em> to the cause of this pleasure. Next
          follows the desire of reciprocated affection—that is, a desire is
          awakened to become the cause of the same pleasure to another; for
          the desire of being loved is the desire to be the cause of
          pleasurable emotions in another mind, in view of our own good
          qualities. When we secure this desired appreciation, then follows
          an increased desire of good to the one who bestows it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the
          affection of love is a combination of the action and reaction of
          pleasurable emotions, all tending to awaken the desire of good to
          another. This passion may become so intensified that it will become
          more delightful to secure enjoyments to another than to procure
          them for self.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In what is thus
          far presented, we find that the desire of good to another results
          solely from the fact that certain mental qualities are <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">causes of pleasure
          to self</span></em>. Of course, this desire ceases when those
          qualities cease to exist or cease to be appreciated. This kind of
          love <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name=
          "Pg116" id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> is the natural
          result of the constitution of minds in their relations to each
          other, making it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">easy and pleasant</span></em> to live for the
          good of another in return for the pleasure received from their
          agreeable qualities and manifestations.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the highest
          element of love consists in the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">desire and purpose
          of good to another without reference to any good received in
          return</span></em>. It is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">good willing</span></em>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The desire of
          good to others exists as a natural impulse more or less powerful in
          differently constituted minds. It is the cause of that pleasure
          which is felt in the consciousness of being the cause of good to
          another. But this natural impulse can be so developed and increased
          by voluntary culture as to become the strongest impulse of the
          mind, and thus the source of the highest and most satisfying
          enjoyments. In many minds this becomes so strongly developed that
          securing happiness to others is sought with far more earnestness
          and pleasure than any modes of enjoyment that terminate solely in
          self.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This analysis
          lays the foundation for the distinction expressed by the terms
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">impulsive
          benevolence</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">voluntary benevolence</span></em>, or the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">love of
          complacency</span></em> and the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">love of
          benevolence</span></em>. The first is the involuntary result of
          good conferred on <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">self</span></em>; the last is a voluntary act.
          It is good willing toward others without reference to self. The
          first can only exist where certain qualities are perceived and
          appreciated in another mind. The second can result from voluntary
          effort, and become the subject of law and penalties.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We can never be
          justly required to love another mind with the love of complacency
          except when qualities are perceived that, by the constitution of
          mind, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span><a name=
          "Pg117" id="Pg117" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> necessarily call
          forth such regard. But the love of benevolence can be justly
          demanded from every mind toward every being capable of
          happiness.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here it is
          important to discriminate more exactly in regard to the principle
          of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">benevolence</span></em> and the principle of
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">rectitude</span></em>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is seen that
          the benevolence which is the subject of rewards and penalties as a
          voluntary act consists in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">good willing</span></em>—that is, in choosing
          the happiness of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">other</span></em> minds as well as our own as
          the object of interest and pursuit.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the
          principle of rectitude is more comprehensive in its nature. It
          relates to obedience to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">all</span></em> the laws of the system of the
          universe—those relating to ourselves as much as those relating to
          others. It is true that, as obedience to these laws includes the
          greatest possible amount of good with the least possible evil, both
          to the individual and the commonwealth, the tendency of the two
          principles is to the same result. But benevolence may be exercised
          without any regard to the rules of right and wrong. Instead of
          striving to make the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">most possible</span></em> happiness with the
          least possible evil, as our Maker's great design demands, a course
          may be taken that makes some happiness to some minds at the expense
          of vast suffering and wrong to others. No mind acts right, even in
          willing happiness to others, when it is done in disregard of those
          laws which demand that we should make happiness the right way, that
          is, the way which is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">best for all</span></em>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the physical
          and mental constitution of man there is not a single arrangement
          the direct object of which is to produce suffering. The
          susceptibilities to pain seem designed to protect and preserve,
          while the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg
          118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          greater the need the more strong is this protection. For example,
          in regard to physical organization, fire is an element that is
          indispensable to the life, comfort, and activity of man, and it
          must be accessible at all times and places. But all its service
          arises from its power to dissolve and destroy the body itself, as
          well as all things around it. Therefore the pain connected with
          contact with fire is more acute than almost any other. Thus even
          the youngest child is taught the care and caution needful to
          protect its body from injury or destruction.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another fact in
          regard to the susceptibilities of pain is their frequent <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">co-existence</span></em> with the highest
          degrees of enjoyment. The experiences of this life often present
          cases where the most elevated and ecstatic happiness is combined
          with the keenest suffering, while such is the nature of the case
          that the suffering is the chief cause of the happiness thus
          secured. The highest illustration of this is in the suffering of
          saints and martyrs, when they <span class="tei tei-q">“rejoice to
          be counted worthy to suffer shame,”</span> or when, amid torturing
          flames, they sing songs of transport and praise.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Even in common
          life it is constantly found that a certain relative amount of
          happiness is felt to be more than a recompense for a given amount
          of pain. This relative amount may be such that the evil involved,
          though great, may count as nothing. Where there is a passionate
          attachment, for example, the lover exults in the labor and
          suffering that will joyfully be received as a proof of affection
          and will secure the compensating return.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is a very
          common fact that painful emotions <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">are
          sought</span></em>, not for themselves, but as ministers to a kind
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span><a name=
          "Pg119" id="Pg119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of mental excitement
          which is desired. This is the foundation of the pleasure which is
          felt in tragic representations, and in poetry and novels that
          present scenes of distress. The little child will again and again
          ask for the tale of the Babes in the Wood, though each rehearsal
          brings forth tears; and the mature matron or sage will spend hours
          over tales that harrow the feelings and call forth sighs. This also
          is the foundation of that kind of music called the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">minor
          key</span></em>, in which certain sounds bring emotions of sadness
          or sorrow.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another striking
          fact in regard to the desire for pain is the emotions that are felt
          by the most noble and benevolent minds at the sight of cruelty and
          injustice. At such scenes, the desire for inflicting pain on the
          guilty offender amounts to a passion which nothing can allay but
          retributive justice. And the more benevolent the mind, the stronger
          this desire for retributive evil to another.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus it appears
          that the mind is so made as to desire pain both for itself and for
          others; not in itself considered, but as the indispensable means to
          gain some consequent enjoyment.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">highest
          kinds</span></em> of happiness result from painful emergencies. The
          transports of love, gratitude, and delight, when some benefactor
          rescues suffering thousands from danger and evil, could exist in no
          other way. All the long train of virtues included in patient toil
          for the good of others, in heroic daring, in brave adventure, in
          fortitude, in patience, in resignation, in heavenly meekness, in
          noble magnanimity, in sublime self-sacrifice, all involve the idea
          of trial, danger, and suffering. It is only the highest and noblest
          class of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg
          120]</span><a name="Pg120" id="Pg120" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          minds that can fully understand that the most blissful of all
          enjoyments are those which are bought with pain.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the most
          cheering feature in the constitution of mind is all that is
          included in the principle of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">habit</span></em>. We see in the commencement
          of existence that every action of mind and body is imperfect, and
          more or less difficult, while each effort to secure right action
          increases the facility of so doing. We see that, owing to this
          principle, every act of obedience to law makes such a course
          easier. The intellect, the susceptibilities, the will, all come
          under this benign influence. Habit may so diminish the difficulty
          of self-denial for our own good that the pain entirely ceases; and
          self-sacrifice for the good of others may so develop benevolence
          and generate a habit that it will become pleasure without pain.
          There are those even in this world, who have so attained this
          capacity of living in the life of those around them, that the
          happiness of others becomes their own, so that there is even less
          pain in self-denial for the good of others than for that of self.
          When this habit of mind is attained by all, the happiness of the
          commonwealth will become the portion of each individual, and thus
          be multiplied to an inconceivable extent.</p>

        <span style="font-size: 173%">Chapter XX. Additional Proof of the
        Moral Attributes of God.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have presented
        the <span class="tei tei-q">“nature”</span> of mind as the chief
        evidence of the grand design of its Creator in forming all things,
        and thus also presented the proof of his perfect wisdom, benevolence,
        and rectitude. We now will trace the evidences of the same beneficent
        design in the nature of all social and material organizations.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">First, then, in
        regard to the domestic relations. We have seen that while all
        happiness depends on obedience to laws, every mind comes into
        existence in perfect ignorance of them, and without any power to
        learn what is good or evil but by experience and instruction. The
        intention of the Creator that each new-born being should be taught
        these laws and trained to obey them, is clearly seen in the first and
        highest domestic relation. In this we see two mature minds, who have
        themselves been trained to understand these laws, drawn by sweet and
        gentle influences to each other. They go apart from all past ties of
        kindred; they have one home, one name, one common interest in every
        thing. The one who has most physical strength goes forth to provide
        supplies; the delicate one remains behind, by domestic ministries to
        render home the centre of all attractions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then comes the
        beautiful, helpless infant, of no use to any one, and demanding
        constant care, labor, and attention. And yet, with its profound
        ignorance, its tender weakness, its delicate beauty, its utter
        helplessness, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg
        122]</span><a name="Pg122" id="Pg122" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> its
        entire dependence, how does it draw forth the strongest feelings of
        love and tenderness, making every toil and care a delight! And thus,
        month after month, both parents unite to cherish and support, while,
        with unceasing vigilance, they train the new-born mind to understand
        and obey the laws of the system into which it is thus ushered. Its
        first lessons are to learn to take care of its own body. And when the
        far-off penalty of pain can not be comprehended by the novice, the
        parent invents new penalties to secure habits of care and obedience.
        During all this period the great lesson of <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sacrifice</span></em>
        constantly occurs. The child must eat what is <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">best</span></em>, not
        what it desires. It must go to bed when it wants to sit up. It must
        stay in the house when it wants to go out. It must not touch
        multitudes of things which it wishes thus to investigate. And so the
        habits of self-denial, obedience, and faith in the parents are
        gradually secured, while the knowledge of the laws of the system
        around are slowly learned.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the higher
        part of the law of sacrifice soon begins to make its demands. The
        child first learns of this law <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">by example</span></em>, in that of <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
        mother</span></em>, that most perfect illustration of
        self-sacrificing love. Then comes a second child, when the first-born
        must practice on this example. It must give up its place in the
        mother's bosom to another; it must share its sweets and toys with the
        new-comer; it must join in efforts to protect, amuse, and instruct
        the helpless one. And thus the family is the constant school for
        training ignorant, inexperienced mind in the laws of the system of
        which it is a part, especially in the great law of self-control, for
        the best good of self, and of self-sacrifice for the best good of
        others.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg
        123]</span><a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next comes the
        discipline of the school and the neighborhood, when the child is
        placed among his peers to be taught new rules of justice,
        benevolence, and self-sacrifice for the general good.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next come the
        relations of the body politic, for which labors are demanded and pain
        is to be endured according to the grand law of sacrifice, by which
        the individual is to subordinate his own interests and wishes to the
        greater general good, so that the interests of the majority shall
        always control those of the minority.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lastly, the whole
        world is to be taken into the estimate, and the nations are to be
        counted as members of one great family of man, for which every
        portion is to make sacrifices for the greater general good.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, as age, and
        experience, and habits of obedience to the laws of rectitude
        increase, the duties and obligations grow more numerous and
        complicated. But the same grand principle is more and more developed,
        that each individual is to seek the greatest possible happiness with
        the least possible evil, for the vast whole as well as for each
        subordinate part, while <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">self</span></em> is to receive only its just and
        proper share.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same great
        design of the Creator can be detected also in specific organizations,
        by which minds so differ from each other as to fit them for the
        diverse positions and relations that the common good demands. If all
        were exactly alike in the amount of constitutional powers and in the
        proportionate combinations, it can easily be seen that the general
        result would be far less favorable to the happiness of the whole. But
        as it is, some have the love of power very large, and seek to lead
        and control; others have it small, and prefer to follow. Some have
        elevated intellect, and love to <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page124">[pg 124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> teach; others have humbler capacities, and
        prefer humbler pursuits.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These varied
        combinations also give scope to the virtues of pity, tenderness,
        patience, mercy, justice, self-denial, and many other graces that
        could not be called into being without all the disparities, social,
        domestic, intellectual, and moral, that we find existing. Meantime
        the principle of habit and the power of the will give abundant
        opportunities for modifying these natural peculiarities to
        accommodate to varying circumstances.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To these
        indications of benevolent design may be added the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“nature”</span> of the bodily system, and the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“nature”</span> of the material world
        without. In examining the body we inhabit, so nicely adjusted, so
        perfectly adapted to our necessities, so beautifully and harmoniously
        arranged, so <span class="tei tei-q">“fearfully and wonderfully
        made,”</span> it is almost beyond the power of numbers to express the
        multiplied contrivances for ease, comfort, and delight.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We daily pursue
        our business and our pleasure, thoughtless of the thousand operations
        which are going on, and the busy mechanism employed in securing the
        objects we desire. The warm current that is flowing from the centre
        to the extremities, with its life-giving energies, and then returning
        to be purified and again sent forth; the myriads of branching nerves
        that are the sensitive discerners of good or ill; the unnumbered
        muscles and tendons that are contracting and expanding in all parts
        of our frame; the nicely-adjusted joints, and bands, and ligaments,
        that sustain, and direct, and support; the perpetual expansion and
        contraction of the vital organ; the thousand hidden contrivances and
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span><a name="Pg125"
        id="Pg125" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> operations of the animal
        frame, all are quietly and constantly performing their generous
        functions, and administering comfort and enjoyment to the conscious
        spirit that dwells within.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor is the outer
        world less busy in performing its part in promoting the great design
        of the Creator. The light of suns and stars is traversing the
        ethereal expanse in search of those for whom it was created; for them
        it gilds the scenes of earth, and is reflected in ten thousand forms
        of beauty and of skill. The trembling air is waiting to minister its
        aid, fanning with cool breezes, or yielding the warmth of spring,
        sustaining the functions of life, and bearing on its light wing the
        thoughts that go forth from mind to mind, and the breathings of
        affection that are given and returned. For this design earth is
        sending forth her exuberance, the waters are emptying their stores,
        and the clouds pouring forth their treasures. All nature is busy with
        its offerings of fruits and flowers, its wandering incense, its
        garnished beauty, and its varied songs. Within and without, above,
        beneath, and around, the same Almighty Beneficence is found still
        ministering to the wants and promoting the happiness of the minds he
        has formed for ever to desire and pursue this boon.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We are now
        prepared to meet the questions proposed, (<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>) is
        the Creator a being who, with the varying humors of man, sometimes
        prefers evil to good, and sometimes prefers good to evil, or does he
        invariably choose what is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">best for all</span></em>, even in cases where it
        may involve personal sacrifices and suffering to himself?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In attempting to
        answer this question, we have set <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> forth the evidence to be found in the works of
        the Creator which establishes the position that his <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">chief end</span></em>
        or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ruling
        purpose</span></em> is to produce the greatest possible happiness
        with the least possible evil.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The question then
        reads, does the Creator destroy happiness and cause needless pain,
        and thus thwart his own chief desire and great end; the end for which
        he made all things?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The very statement
        of the question is its most forcible answer.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have seen that
        we are obliged to conceive of God as possessing such a social and
        moral nature as our own. This would lead him to desire the
        veneration, confidence, love, and gratitude of the children he has
        created.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But he has formed
        their minds to hate selfishness and to admire and reverence
        self-sacrificing benevolence. Will the Creator then oppose his own
        chief end and grand design by conduct which would make all his
        creatures necessarily, by the nature he implanted, withhold their
        respect and love, and feel only dislike and contempt? The very
        question involves its own answer.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Add to this, that
        all those causes which our experience and observation have shown to
        lead to wrong choices are necessarily excluded from our conceptions
        of the Creator.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Eternal Mind
        can not err for want of knowledge, nor for want of habits of right
        action, nor for want of teachers and educators, nor for want of those
        social influences which generate and sustain a right governing
        purpose; for an infinite mind, that never had a beginning, can not
        have these modes of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg
        127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        experience which appertain to new-born and finite creatures.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again: Such is the
        eternal system of the universe, as we learn it by the light of
        reason, that the highest possible happiness to each individual mind
        and to the whole commonwealth is promoted by the right action of
        every mind in that system. This, of necessity, is seen and felt by
        the All-creating and Eternal Mind, and to suppose that, with this
        knowledge, he would ever choose wrong, is to suppose that he would
        choose pure evil. It is to suppose the Creator would do what he has
        formed our minds to believe to be impossible in <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">any</span></em>
        rational mind. It is to suppose that the Creator would do that which,
        if done by human beings, marks them as insane.</p>

        in Construction.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first article
        in every system of religion is, who is the God who controls our
        destinies, and what is his character?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In attempting to
        answer this question by the light of nature, independently of
        revelation, we have gained these positions. There is an Intelligent
        Mind who created all things, whose natural attributes are the same as
        ours in kind, but vast beyond our comprehension in extent. In moral
        character, or that which is exhibited in choice or action, he is
        perfect in wisdom, benevolence, and rectitude; that is to say, he is
        a being whose chief end or ruling purpose is to do the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> best he can to make the most possible
        happiness with the least possible evil.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This being
        discovered as the grand design for which all human minds are created,
        we are thus enabled to decide as to what is the right and perfect
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">construction</span></em> or <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“nature”</span> of mind, and also as to its right and
        perfect <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">action</span></em>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In regard to the
        perfect <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">construction</span></em> of mind, we must again
        refer to the fact that in a system of things where both natural and
        moral evil exist, we are obliged to suppose a limitation of power by
        the nature of things, so that a system is perfect, not as excluding
        all evil; for as evil does exist, a system without any evil is
        impossible. All that remains, then, to constitute the idea of
        perfection, (as used in reference to things as they are) is this,
        that whatever is created by God, is the best possible in the nature
        of things.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The question then
        must be this, is the mind of man, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as a
        race</span></em>, the best in construction, that is possible in the
        nature of things? Is our mind made <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as good as it can
        be</span></em>, so that no change is possible that would make it
        better?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In replying to
        this question, we must regard the matter in two relations. We have
        noticed, in the chapter on the Constitutional Varieties of the Human
        Mind, that while there are powers and attributes of mind which are
        common to all, there is an endless variety of character resulting
        from the diverse <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">proportions</span></em> and <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">combinations</span></em> of these several
        faculties, and also that there are diverse <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">grades</span></em> of
        mind, each having these diverse combinations. Some races of men are
        much lower in the scale of being, every way, than other races, while
        the same disparity exists among individuals of the same
        race.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg
        129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now when we
        compare individuals with each other, or when we compare races in
        these respects, we regard them as more or less perfect in
        organization with reference to the highest grade or species known to
        us. In this relation some minds are to be regarded as imperfect and
        defective in organization. And in reference to any one individual or
        race in this relation, we feel that the organization could be
        improved.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But when we regard
        each mind as a part of a vast <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">system</span></em>, in which the highest good of
        the whole will prove the highest possible good of each individual
        part, we are to judge of perfection in the organization of mind in
        another relation. If it is for the greatest happiness of the whole
        that there should be grades and ranks in mental powers; if
        disparities and varieties in organization give scope and exercise to
        virtues and modes of enjoyment that would be impossible were all
        minds exactly alike, and on the pattern of the highest in the scale
        of being, then the very points which are imperfections in the
        individual relations, become perfections in relation to the great
        whole. In this view, the lowest and humblest in the scale of being,
        when acting in his appropriate place and according to the great
        Creator's design, is perfect in mental construction, and is fitted to
        be happier in every respect than he could be if the whole system were
        changed by placing him among the highest in mental organization.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Just as it is with
        the human system—the lowly foot is perfect and complete in its place,
        though inferior in construction and service to the regal head and
        cunning hand. And should the foot be endowed with the higher gifts it
        would be a departure from its perfection <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> in organization as related to the whole. The
        question, then, of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">perfect nature</span></em> of each human mind
        requires that we regard each one as a part of an infinite system
        demanding grades and ranks, and thus, also, relative disparities. And
        having proved that the chief design of the Creator is to make the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">best
        possible</span></em> system, we are necessarily led to the conclusion
        that the lowest order of mind is as perfect in its nature, in
        relation to the great whole, as is the highest of all.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the above we
        gain this definition:</p>

        is one which is better fitted to its position in the best <em class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here we must again

        from the constitution of mind, of which God is the producing cause,

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This introduces
        the second part of the system of natural religion, that which relates
        to man's obligations or duty toward the Creator, toward his fellow

        <span class="tei tei-q">“what is <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">right voluntary or
        moral action</span></em>?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In seeking the
        reply to this without the aid of revelation, the following
        particulars demand attention:</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In all discussions
        on this question there is no mental analysis more important than the
        distinction between the desire, or what <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">moves</span></em> us
        to choose, and the act of choice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The mind is always
        moved to choice by desire for some good to be gained or some evil to
        be avoided. The susceptibility or power of being thus led, in popular
        language is called a <span class="tei tei-q">“bias,”</span> an
        <span class="tei tei-q">“inclination,”</span> a <span class=

        "tei tei-q">“proclivity”</span> toward the object which causes the
        desire. Thus the susceptibility to desire stimulating drinks is
        excited by liquors, and this is called <span class="tei tei-q">“a
        propensity”</span> to strong drink.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The susceptibility
        to desire to amass money is called a bias, or propensity to avarice.
        The only thing ever meant by a bias or propensity to choose any thing
        is, that there are such susceptibilities that desire can be excited
        for that thing.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg

        good</span></em> in the widest sense of these terms. No rational mind
        ever desires pure evil, but always desires good of some sort. On the
        contrary, it is one of the implanted principles of common sense that
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no rational
        mind will choose pure evil</span></em>. Any man who should do this
        would be regarded as insane—as having lost the distinctive feature of
        a rational mind.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But we find that
        desires are called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        and the like, not at all with reference to the question whether what
        is desired would be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">best</span></em> for all concerned. They are
        measured, as to strength or weakness, by the degrees of enjoyment
        their gratification secures, or the amount of pain that self-denial
        would involve. This <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">measurement</span></em> of varied degrees of
        pleasure and pain is a matter of consciousness to every mind, and is
        constantly referred to by all races and in all languages.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this use of the
        term, the strongest desire often exists for that which is perceived
        to be the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">best</span></em> good for all concerned. At
        other times the strongest desire is for that which is seen to be the
        lesser good. When the strongest desire is for that which is best, the
        choice is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">easy</span></em>, and the mind always chooses
        the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">best</span></em> good. But when the strongest
        desire is for that which is not best, then choice is more difficult,
        and there is a conscious struggle between the promptings of reason
        and conscience, and the importunities of strong desire for the lesser
        good.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At such periods
        there is a conscious <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          furnishes the ground for the distinctions <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page134">[pg 134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> always recognized between voluntary action
          which is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">right</span></em> as <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">best</span></em>
          for all concerned, and those actions which are deemed <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">praiseworthy</span></em>, <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">rewardable</span></em>, and <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">meritorious</span></em>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whenever the
          dictates of reason and our strongest desire are coincident, so that
          choosing what is right and best involves no struggle; then the
          ideas of merit and of desert of reward, praise, and commendation
          are wanting. We say such acts are right, but there is no merit in
          them, and no proper ground for adding any other reward than that
          which naturally results from choosing what we desire most, and
          which is best for us and for all concerned.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the contrary,
          when there is a struggle between a sense of what is right and best,
          and the strongest desire, and a choice is made which involves
          self-denial and self-sacrifice, we feel that the act is one which
          is meritorious, and deserving of reward and praise.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Any voluntary
          action, then, is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">right</span></em> which is conformed to those
          rules of rectitude which tend to secure <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
          most</span></em> happiness for all, even when there is no
          temptation to another course. But an action is <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">meritorious</span></em> and <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">rewardable</span></em> only when there is a
          reference to the rules of rectitude in the mind of the actor and
          some degree of self-denial. To choose what we desire most, without
          any regard to what is right or wrong, even when it chances that our
          choice is that which is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">best</span></em>, and thus <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">right</span></em>,
          does not meet our idea of a meritorious and praiseworthy act.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The greater
          portion of our choices are of those things which are good in all
          relations, as best for self and best for all concerned. Thus when
          we desire to eat, to drink, to breathe the pure air, to admire the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg 135]</span><a name=
          "Pg135" id="Pg135" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> beauties of nature,
          to enjoy the society of friends,—to choose these and a thousand
          other daily blessings, promotes our own best good and the best good
          of all concerned. In all such cases choosing what we desire most is
          morally <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">right</span></em> in all relations. But no
          acts of choice are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">meritorious</span></em>, except as they
          involve a regard to law in the mind of the actor, and some degree
          of self-denial in conforming to rule.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The only cases
          where moral evil (or wrong choices) can exist, are where desires
          are excited for some good, either for ourselves or for others,
          which is not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">best for all concerned</span></em>. In all
          such cases there is a <span class="tei tei-q">“bias,”</span>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“tendency,”</span> and <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“propensity”</span> to choose <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good</span></em> of
          some sort, but it is not the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">best</span></em> good, and therefore to choose
          it would be morally wrong. Thus there is a bias or propensity to
          what is good in one relation, but evil in another; good as tending
          to give enjoyment, but evil as contrary to a law which enjoins that
          the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">best</span></em> good should always be
          preferred.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In such cases
          the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">desires</span></em> for a good which is not
          for the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">best</span></em> are not morally wrong, for
          they arise involuntarily from those susceptibilities implanted by
          God, which are not to be exterminated, but only regulated by law.
          The moral evil consists not in the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">existence</span></em> of such desires, but in
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">choosing</span></em> to gratify them at the
          sacrifice of the best good of self or of others.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been
          shown that one result of the wrong action of mind is such a change
          in its constitutional nature, that there will be a desire to
          inflict evil on others as a malignant pleasure to the guilty mind.
          In these cases such desires may properly be called <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">morally
          wrong</span></em> because they are the result of the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">voluntary</span></em> action of the sinful
          mind, and not of the natural susceptibilities <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name="Pg136" id="Pg136"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> implanted by the Creator. As they
          result wholly from wrong previous choices, the guilty mind itself
          is the author of them and not the Creator of mind.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here it is
          important to discriminate in regard to that natural impulse in all
          minds which is excited by the infliction of pain on self or on
          others. It is this natural impulse to inflict evil on the author of
          evil which is the foundation of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">justice</span></em>
          in the family and in the civil state. Its design is for the best
          good of all concerned, and it becomes evil only by excess and
          misuse. So long as it is controlled by reason and conscience it is
          good and only good.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In view of the
          above distinctions, there can be no moral evil in <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">desires</span></em>
          for things which it would be wrong to choose, <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">except as these
          desires are the result of previous wrong choices</span></em>.<a id=
          "noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href="#note_7"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been
          shown that the principle of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">habit</span></em> renders it more and more
          easy and agreeable to regulate our choices by the rules of
          rectitude. The habit of sacrificing personal gratification to the
          rule of duty may be so cultivated that what at first was difficult,
          and involved a painful struggle, becomes easy. It is possible so to
          cultivate such habits that our highest desires, and the dictates of
          reason and conscience, shall continually be more and more
          coincident.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We can conceive
          of newly-created beings as placed in such circumstances that, for a
          considerable period, all their strongest desires may be coincident
          with the best good of themselves and of others, so that there can
          be no opportunity to practice self-control in regulating their
          desires by the rules of rectitude. In such a case, <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> while acting simply from impulse,
          without reference to rule, they would always act <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">right</span></em>,
          and yet they would form no habits of self-control, and thus would
          be liable to fail at the first temptation where their strongest
          desire conflicted with the known law of rectitude.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The preceding
          statements are made in order to arrive at correct and
          discriminating definitions of certain fundamental terms on which
          the whole question of the <span class="tei tei-q">“depraved
          nature”</span> of the human mind will be found to turn.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mankind in all
          ages and in all languages speak of certain acts as right or wrong
          in reference to their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tendency</span></em> or their effect on human
          happiness, and without reference to the intention of the author.
          Thus they affirm that the stealing and selling of men is wrong,
          whatever may be the motives of the slave trader.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, they
          speak of acts as right or wrong in reference to the <em class=

          or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, it has
          been shown that a man may form a <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">general
          purpose</span></em> to act right in obeying all the laws of God as
          discoverable by reason or revelation. This general purpose may be a
          quiet, abiding principle, so as to regulate the thoughts and
          emotions, and may control <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg
          138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          most of the specific choices of a whole succeeding life. The
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">main
          purpose</span></em>, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">chief end</span></em> of such a man is to
          bring all his thoughts, words, and actions into perfect agreement
          with the rules of rectitude. In reference to this and his
          consequent conduct, his would be denominated a <em class=

          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">natural
          character</span></em> of a man is that which results from his
          constitutional powers and faculties of mind, of which God is the
          author.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">moral

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our highest idea
          of a virtuous character, as gained by experience and observation,
          is that of a mind so trained to habits of self-control and
          obedience to rule, that it has become easier to obey the laws of
          rectitude, than to gratify any excited desire, however imperative,
          which is seen to violate law.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, then, it
          is shown that a virtuous character consists, not in the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em>
          of the mind which is given by God, but in the <em class=

          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">habits</span></em>,
          and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">feelings</span></em> generated by voluntary
          acts, of which the man himself is the author; God being the cause
          or author, of this virtue only as he is the Creator of mind and of
          all its circumstances of temptation and trial.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In regard to the
          formation of a virtuous character, as a matter of experience, it
          usually results from a slow and gradual process of training and
          development. The general purpose to obey all the laws of rectitude
          originates, as a general fact, not as a definitely formed purpose,
          whose time of inception can be distinctly marked. Yet it is not
          unfrequently the case that persons who have passed a life of
          unrestrained indulgence, by some marked and powerful influence, are
          suddenly led to a decided and definitely marked purpose of virtuous
          obedience, and carry out this purpose with great success.</p>

          <span style="font-size: 144%">Is True Virtue Possible before
          Regeneration?</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
          discussions which are to follow, it will be found that almost every
          point debated involves, as a foundation question, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“what <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">is</span></em> true virtue?”</span> And the
          grand question at issue between the system of common sense and the
          teachings of all theologians who uphold the Augustine theory, is
          this: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is
          true virtue possible to an unregenerate mind</span></em>? Theology
          says no, common sense says yes. Theology teaches that previous to
          regeneration every voluntary act of every human mind is
          <span class="tei tei-q">“sin, and only sin.”</span> Common sense
          maintains, on the contrary, that every voluntary act which is in
          agreement with the best good of all concerned, when the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">intention</span></em> is to act right, is
          virtuous without any regard to the question of the regeneration of
          the mind. In other words, theology teaches that true virtue is the
          right voluntary action of a mind after its <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“nature”</span> is changed by God, and common sense
          teaches that true virtue is the right voluntary action of any mind
          without any change in its nature.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The discussion
          of this point involves the further consideration of certain mental
          experiences which will shed some light on the subject. It will be
          found that in case of all persons who are said to <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“act on principle,”</span> or to be <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“conscientious persons,”</span> that, in the greater
          portion of their voluntary acts, they have no <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">conscious</span></em> immediate reference to
          the rules of rectitude. There seems to be an unconscious general
          purpose to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg
          141]</span><a name="Pg141" id="Pg141" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          act right on all occasions, which becomes obvious only when a case
          occurs involving a seeming violation of the rules of rectitude. At
          such times the mind becomes conscious of its ruling purpose. But
          the greater portion of all the daily acts of life have been decided
          upon as in agreement with the all-controlling general purpose, and
          a man chooses to do many things in which he has no <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">conscious</span></em> reference to rule. And
          still such acts have, in past time, been subjects of reflection in
          reference to the question of right and wrong, and have been decided
          to be right, and it is in consequence of this decision that the
          mind no longer considers these questions with a conscious reference
          to rule.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The distinction
          between what is denominated <span class="tei tei-q">“a man of
          principle”</span> and an <span class="tei tei-q">“unprincipled
          man,”</span> is simply this, that the former is one who has formed
          habits of self-regulation by the rules of rectitude, and the latter
          has not.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This mental
          analysis is important in reference to deciding the character of
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          virtuous action</span></em>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A virtuous act,
          as defined above, is one in which the thing chosen is right and the
          motive is right. But it is not indispensable that the person who
          performs the act should be immediately <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">conscious</span></em> of a reference to rule
          in each right specific volition. It is sufficient that the mind be
          under the control of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ruling purpose</span></em> of rectitude, so
          that all the subordinate minor purposes are in fact regulated,
          though unconsciously, by this purpose.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is at this
          point that the class of theologians who make regeneration to
          include a voluntary act on the part of man, are in antagonism with
          the experience <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg
          142]</span><a name="Pg142" id="Pg142" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          and common sense of mankind. Such maintain that every act of every
          human being is <span class="tei tei-q">“sin, and only sin,”</span>
          until a ruling purpose is formed to obey God as the chief end, and
          one also which is actually <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">more</span></em> efficient and stronger in
          controlling the ordinary acts of life than the purpose to gratify
          self. Previous to the existence of this general purpose, they
          maintain that every act of self-denial or self-sacrifice for the
          good of others is <span class="tei tei-q">“sin, and only
          sin.”</span> According to their theory, choosing that which is
          right because it is right, is not a virtuous act until a ruling
          purpose of universal obedience to God is formed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That is to say,
          it is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ruling purpose</span></em>, or <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
          want</span></em> of a ruling purpose to obey God in all things,
          which decides the character of every specific act of choice. Thus
          if a child is trained to be honest, truthful, and self-denying, and
          succeeds very often in conforming to such instructions, there is no
          true virtue in any such acts until a <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ruling
          purpose</span></em> of obedience to God is generated, which is
          habitually <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">more</span></em> controlling than the impulses
          of self-indulgence. This is the point where <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
          people</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">theologians</span></em> are at issue.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The people
          insist that every act is virtuous when the thing chosen is right
          and the intention is right, even before the mind of a child has
          attained a ruling purpose of universal obedience. Theologians say
          no; such acts are <span class="tei tei-q">“sin, and only
          sin,”</span> in the sight of God.<a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8"
          href="#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will be shown
          hereafter that the theory of theology on this subject is not
          carried out consistently in practice, but that in the early
          training of little children theologians contradict their own theory
          and adopt that of the people.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In a previous
          chapter we have seen [p. <a href="#Pg103" class=
          "tei tei-ref">103</a>] that our idea of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=

          action always has reference to <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">power</span></em>.
          In a system where evil is actually existing, we regard a
          contrivance or an action as perfect when there is no power in God
          or man to make it better, even when evil is involved. A being is
          perfect in character and in action when his purpose is to do the
          best possible for all concerned, and when this purpose is carried
          out to the full extent of his power.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have shown in
          the preceding chapter that the mind of man is perfect in <em class=

          or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          fitted to its place in the best possible system of mind than it
          would be by any change possible either to God or man.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The preceding
          pages of this chapter enable us to point out what is the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perfect moral
          character</span></em> of minds which are perfect in construction.
          It consists in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">a ruling purpose to discover and to obey all
          the laws of the Creator, which is carried out to the full extent of
          power in the one who thus purposes</span></em>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been
          shown that the Creator himself is limited by the eternal nature of
          things to a system which, though the best possible, makes him, in
          one sense, the author of some evil, both natural and moral. He is
          the author only as the Creator of all things, and thus the author
          of all the consequent results of creation, even of those that are
          morally evil. In this sense alone is he the author of either
          natural or moral evil.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The infinite and
          eternal mind of God is limited, not <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          eternal nature of things of which his own existence and natural
          attributes are a part. But finite minds are limited by a want of
          knowledge and wisdom which can be the result only of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">experience and
          training</span></em>. For the want of this knowledge and training
          every finite mind, so far as we can discover by reason and
          experience, must inevitably violate the laws of God. And yet any
          mind may be perfect in moral character and action in exactly the
          same sense as God is perfect, (<span class=

        "font-style: italic">invariable</span></em> arrangements in mind and
        matter by which happiness or pain are connected with certain feelings
        and actions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus it is an
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">invariable</span></em> arrangement that pain
        shall be connected with touching fire, and pleasure with seeing the
        light. So in regard to the intellect; pleasure is <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">invariably</span></em> connected with the
        exercise of wit and humor, and disgust with folly and fatuity. So the
        moral sense is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">invariably</span></em> pleased with truth,
        justice, and integrity, and pained by the opposite.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whenever,
        therefore, we discover what <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">invariably</span></em> affords pleasure or pain,
        we discover one of the laws of God.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To discover these
        laws, and to believe in them, is as indispensable to the right action
        of mind as light is indispensable to perfect eyes in order to
        see.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first lesson
        of every new-born spirit is to discover the laws that relate to its
        own enjoyment. Whenever a child chooses any thing which secures
        enjoyment without harm to itself or to others, it is acting as its
        Creator designed, and this action is therefore right. And whenever it
        chooses what will cause needless pain to itself or to others, it acts
        wrong. Most of the choices of a little child are of what is right as
        giving enjoyment without harm.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The grand law of
        God, as learned by experience, is that every mind must <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sacrifice</span></em>
        the lesser for the greater <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg
        146]</span><a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        good in gratifying its own desires. When the interests of others are
        not concerned, the child must always choose not what it desires the
        most, but what is best for itself. It is the first labor of the
        educator to make a child understand and obey this first part of the
        law of sacrifice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But where the
        feelings and interests of others are involved, the law of God is,
        that the lesser good of the individual shall always be sacrificed to
        the greater good of the many. Each mind of the great commonwealth is
        to act, not to make self-gratification the first thing, but to make
        the greatest possible happiness with the least possible evil for the
        whole commonwealth the predominant purpose. And such is the system of
        the Creator that whatever is for the best good of the whole is for
        the best good of each individual.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus it appears
        that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        it is very certain that no human mind is able, by its own solitary
        investigations, to discover all the physical, intellectual, social,
        and moral laws of God.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many of these laws

        to define the kind of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">inability</span></em> as to obeying the laws of
        God, which inevitably attends every mind that commences its existence
        in this world. As yet there have never been perfectly <em class=

        that is to say, <span class="tei tei-q">“saving faith,”</span> in the
        teachings that are true is as much wanting. The young child can not
        be made to understand, and therefore can not believe, or have faith
        in many of the laws of God and the penalties connected with them.
        This no one will deny.</p>

          <span style="font-size: 144%">Several Classes of Moral
          Actions.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are
          several classes of moral actions. The first class includes those
          which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in
          all cases</span></em> destroy the best good of man. Of these are
          wanton cruelty to helpless creatures, and ingratitude in returning
          needless evil for good. In regard to such the mind, by its very
          constitutional impulses, revolts from them and feels them to be
          wrong without any process of reasoning. So also all those actions
          that in all cases cause enjoyment without evil, are instinctively
          felt to be right without any reflection.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But there are
          many actions that are entirely dependent on circumstances for their
          moral character. Thus to punish a little child in one case would be
          cruel and wrong, in another it might be benevolent and right. To
          take a woman, when not married to another, for a wife is right, but
          wrong if she is married. And so with thousands of other
          actions.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, some
          actions that do no harm to any individual at a given time, are
          wrong because they would <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg
          148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          be destructive to general happiness, if generally allowed; or, in
          other words, they are wrong in <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tendency</span></em>.
          Thus, in a given case, a lie might do a great deal of good and no
          immediate harm. And yet it would be wrong, because leaving it to
          every man's discretion when it was <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">best</span></em> to
          lie would in the end destroy all confidence in human testimony.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, many of
          the laws of God can be discovered only by long experience of many
          communities. As soon as experience has shown that any practice will
          do more harm than good, then the law of God is discovered and it
          becomes obligatory. Thus the question of polygamy has been settled.
          Thus, too, the vending of alcoholic drinks has been decided to be
          wrong as a general practice.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here comes up
          the distinction between wrong choices that deserve blame and
          punishment, and those that do not. In the natural system of the
          Creator all violations of law are followed by the natural penalties
          without any reference to the motives, knowledge, or ability of the
          agent. All questions among men, as to blame and retribution, have
          reference to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">adding</span></em> of other penalties and
          rewards in the present or future state. It is only in regard to
          such that the questions of blame, of justice, and of mercy are to
          be debated. Without revelation we have no evidence that the natural
          penalties of law are ever suspended, either as a matter of justice
          or mercy. In the case of great crimes and wrongs, that <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">additional</span></em> penalties are to follow
          in a future state is what all men fear, and this it is which
          induces self-inflictions to secure pardon for sin.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now these are
          distinctions existing in all rational minds, and are continually
          referred to in every-day <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg
          149]</span><a name="Pg149" id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          life. But it is impossible for any but an omniscient being to
          decide on all the motives that regulate the actions of others,
          while even our own motives are often so hidden and complex that we
          are blinded as to their true character.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The language of
          common life does not always recognize these distinctions. When a
          wrong action is done the actor is called a wrong-doer, and is
          blamed for the deed. And the fact that he believed that he was
          acting right, and even that he practices self-denial in performing
          what is imagined to be a duty, though it palliates, does not
          ordinarily end all displeasure. For in multitudes of cases the
          ignorance of duty results from pride or selfish neglect of inquiry.
          And few are competent to decide how far the ignorance is a
          misfortune and not a fault.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is owing to
          this fact that most of the language of life assumes that all
          violations of law are blamably wrong, and are to be punished here
          or hereafter. In the most common use of the term, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“sin is the transgression of law.”</span> At the same
          time men recognize the distinction between sins of ignorance and
          willful sin.</p>

          <span style="font-size: 144%">Sin and Holiness.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The preceding,
          then, warrants the definition of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sin</span></em> as
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">the transgression of law</span></em>,”</span>
          whether known or unknown. The question of the rectitude of
          penalties <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">added</span></em> to the natural consequences
          of violated laws, is confined to those sins which are attended by a
          knowledge of law and ability to understand and obey.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These
          distinctions and definitions are important because a large class of
          theologians maintain that sin is <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page150">[pg 150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> the voluntary transgression of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">known</span></em>
          law, and make this definition the foundation of their assertion
          that all men have power to be perfect in conformity to all law,
          meaning by this all the laws of God that they <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">know</span></em>
          and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">believe</span></em>. On this theory <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sin</span></em> is
          the transgression of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">known</span></em> law, and not of that which
          is unknown. And on this theory one way to keep children from sin
          would be to keep them in ignorance of God's laws.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The writer
          maintains that this limited use is not the common meaning. Mankind
          do not stop to settle the question whether men were ignorant of
          what was right, before they decide that they sin. Often such
          ignorance results from an unwillingness or indolence that prevents
          attention, and few can decide how far our ignorance of law results
          from guilty neglect. It is true that when a perfect and innocent
          inability to know law is proved, the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">added</span></em>
          penalties of statute law are remitted. But still the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">natural</span></em>
          penalties are unremitted.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The word
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">holy</span></em> in its original use signifies
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">set
          apart</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">consecrate to the special service</span></em>
          of some deity. Thus the vessels of a temple, the priests and the
          building are called holy in this sense. In reference to moral acts
          or choices, this term is used as recognizing the fact that a mind
          may be voluntarily consecrated or devoted to the service of God by
          right action, or obedience to his laws. God himself is called holy
          on the supposition that there are rules of right and wrong in the
          nature of things, independent of his will, and that his will is
          conformed to these rules, while men are called holy in reference
          chiefly to the will or service of their Creator.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Creator
          holiness signifies perfect voluntary conformity to that which is

          holiness is perfect conformity of will to the laws or <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em> of
          God, both absolutely and in motive or intention. A mind is
          consecrated to God when its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ruling purpose</span></em> is to obey him in
          all things. In this use of the term holiness in man, is what can
          not be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">created</span></em>, as it is a voluntary act
          of his own mind.</p>

          <span class="tei tei-q">“unholy nature,”</span> must be settled by
          a clear definition of the words employed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the term
          <span class="tei tei-q">“nature”</span> refers to the construction

        Man.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In a former
        chapter we have noticed the analysis of the principle of <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">love</span></em>. It
        is needful to refer to this <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg
        152]</span><a name="Pg152" id="Pg152" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        again, as intimately connected with the question of the right moral
        action of finite minds.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have seen that
        love is a complex exercise, its first element being agreeable
        emotions in view of certain qualities and actions. Combined with
        these emotions co-exists a desire of reciprocated regard, that is to
        say, a desire to be the cause of similar agreeable emotions to the
        one loved. These are constitutional impulses not at all consequent on
        any volition or choice, and as the involuntary element of love, are
        properly called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">involuntary love</span></em>. Such love can not
        be justly demanded except where those qualities are, or can be,
        perceived which naturally awaken agreeable emotions. In cases where
        the qualities exist that would naturally awaken affection if noticed,
        and the want of it is owing to inattention, a proper regard to such
        qualities can be justly demanded. But this is the only particular in
        which involuntary love can be made the subject of law and
        penalties.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the main
        element of love, as practically estimated among men, is such a desire
        of good to the one loved as involves the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good
        willing</span></em> or voluntary effort to please and gratify. If a
        friend simply is pleased with our good qualities, and wishes to
        please us with his naturally agreeable traits in return, it is of
        little value in comparison with the truer love which is shown in
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">voluntary</span></em> efforts to please and make
        happy. This last is the main element of true affection, and properly
        is called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">voluntary love</span></em> or <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good
        willing</span></em>. Theologians express this distinction by the
        terms the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">love of complacency</span></em> and the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">love of
        benevolence</span></em>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus we have
        gained these definitions:</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Involuntary
        love</span></em> toward God and toward men consists <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in agreeable emotions in view of
        admirable qualities.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Voluntary
        love</span></em> toward God and toward men consists in <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good
        willing</span></em>, or the voluntary effort to please and make
        happy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“love our neighbor <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">as ourselves</span></em>”</span> must refer
        solely to voluntary love, for we have no regard to our own agreeable
        qualities in the love of self. Self-love is simply the desire and
        will to please and gratify self. This then is <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the kind</span></em>
        of love that can properly be demanded of all. Each one can justly be
        required to will or choose to please and gratify others the same as
        we do ourselves. Each can be required to estimate the happiness of
        every other mind as of the same value as his own, and to exercise
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good
        willing</span></em> for others as we do for our own enjoyment. From
        this primary principle necessarily results the law demanding that the
        good of the commonwealth shall always take precedence of any
        individual concern. If we are bound to value the happiness of each
        mind as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">equal</span></em> in value to our own, the
        inevitable result is that we are to estimate the happiness of
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">many</span></em> minds as of <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">more</span></em>
        value than our own, so as always to make our own enjoyment and wishes
        subordinate and secondary to the general good.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Still more are we
        to regard the feelings and wishes of our Creator and Supreme Lord. He
        has infinite susceptibilities of enjoyment and suffering, and thus
        whatever retards or promotes his wishes and plans must be of as much
        more value as his powers of enjoyment and suffering are greater than
        ours. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">love of good willing</span></em> then should
        have first reference to God as the one whose will and wishes are of
        more <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a name=
        "Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> value than any other
        being in this relation alone. Still more are we bound to regard his
        will and wishes as first in value, because his chief end and aim is
        the most possible happiness to all the creatures he has made. To will
        to please God as the chief end of our existence is the same as to
        choose to make the most possible happiness, not only to him, but to
        all his creatures.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Involuntary love
        is valuable as rendering it easier and more agreeable to labor for
        the welfare of others. Those whose interesting traits please us;
        those who, as children or friends, contribute to our enjoyment, and
        those who in any way give us pleasure, it is far easier to will for
        their enjoyment than it is to do so for those who do nothing to
        please us, and perhaps only give us discomfort, anxiety or
        disgust.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This exhibits an
        indirect way of securing the love of good will toward those who
        neither please us by their agreeable qualities, nor are causes of
        enjoyment to us in any way. Involuntary affection may be so strongly
        excited toward one whose qualities or conduct cause delight to self,
        that the desire to please that friend may become more animating than
        the desire for any personal gratification. Should such a friend be
        deeply interested in the happiness of his children, or of any other
        persons, whose character and conduct may in no way please us, still
        the desire to gratify such a friend may lead to good willing to those
        whom he loves, for his sake, in order to please and gratify him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus it is that
        love to parents tends to produce <span class="tei tei-q">“peace and
        good will”</span> among children, who, in their <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> little broils, are restrained by the
        desire to please their parents, when love to each other fails.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here we have a
        view of the importance of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">right conceptions</span></em> of God's
        character, in order to secure the perfect action of finite minds,
        especially in the first stage of existence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been shown
        that the rules of right action are to be gained, in many cases, only
        by long experience and by a course of reasoning. Often, too, general
        rules (such, for example, as that we are <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">never to
        lie</span></em>, even to save life, or for <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">any</span></em>
        reason,) must be obeyed when a person can see immediate evil, and no
        good to self or to any one by obedience. Now it is impossible for a
        rational mind to choose <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">pure evil</span></em>. There must be <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">some good</span></em>
        in an object to excite desire, or it is impossible to choose it. But
        pleasurable emotions toward an all-wise Creator, whose benevolence
        and wisdom excite love, delight, and confidence, may be such that
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to please
        him</span></em> gives abundant motive to obey the rules of right he
        enjoins when no other good can be perceived except that obedience
        will please him. And the more we perceive in him that excites
        admiration, love, and gratitude, the more strength of motive is
        gained.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been shown
        that a choice or act is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">virtuous</span></em> in all relations, when it
        absolutely is best for all, and when it is done in reference to a
        rule of rectitude, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">because</span></em> it is right. The motive or
        reason of a choice decides whether or not it is virtuous.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now as the
        Creator's will and the rules of rectitude are the same, when we say
        that any act, in order to be virtuous, must have reference to God's
        will, the question comes up, is an act virtuous <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">because it pleases
        God</span></em>, or does it please God <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">because it is
        virtuous</span></em>? <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> because it conforms to those rules by which his
        chief end in creation is secured, and which rest on the eternal
        nature of things.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The last is the
        principle here assumed. God's great end is the highest happiness of
        his creatures. Obedience to his laws is the mode for securing this
        end; his own actions are right as they conform to this end; and the
        actions of all his creatures are right only in the same relation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So God's
        <span class="tei tei-q">“glory”</span> consists in the highest
        happiness of his creatures, which can only be secured by their
        obedience to his laws.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This makes it
        clear that choosing as our chief end to obey all the physical,
        social, and moral laws of God, as learned by experience, is the same
        as loving God with all the heart, and our neighbors as ourselves. It
        is also living for God's glory as the chief end; and it is being a
        truly righteous, virtuous, and pious man.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This distinction
        between voluntary and involuntary love enables us to discover certain
        dangers that result for want of such discrimination. Men may conceive
        of the Creator as desiring to be loved, admired, and glorified, just
        as selfish conquerors, like Alexander and Napoleon have done. In this
        view all their aims would be to excite agreeable emotions toward God
        by the contemplation of his various attributes. And thus they might
        be so absorbed in the indulgence of such delightful emotions as to
        become entirely heedless of the wants and the wishes of those around
        them. This kind of experience would cultivate selfishness instead of
        benevolence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the contrary,
        choosing to obey all God's laws for happiness-making on the largest
        scale, and viewing <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg
        157]</span><a name="Pg157" id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the
        lovely and glorious attributes of the Creator as <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">means</span></em> to
        this end, would induce the only true virtue, while it is the true
        mode of pleasing our Maker and increasing his enjoyment.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The preceding
        furnishes the mode of harmonizing a great variety of expressions that
        may properly be given in answer to the great question, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“what must we do to be saved?”</span> as we gain this
        answer independently of revelation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first answer
        is, <span class="tei tei-q">“believe in God's teachings—or have faith
        in God.”</span> This means, take the laws of God as revealed by
        reason and experience, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">obey</span></em> them, and you shall be saved.
        It is a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">practical</span></em> and not a mere
        intellectual belief that constitutes this <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“saving faith.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next answer
        is, <span class="tei tei-q">“repent,”</span> or <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“repentance toward God.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The word repent is
        used to signify, sometimes, simply remorse or pain for wrong-doing.
        In another sense it signifies that sorrow for wrong-doing which
        includes reformation. It is ceasing to disobey law and commencing a
        life of obedience. It is in this sense that men are saved by
        repentance.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another answer is,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all
        thy heart, and thy neighbor as thyself.”</span> This has been shown
        to signify, thou shalt choose as the chief end of life to make
        happiness the right way, that is, by obeying all the physical,
        social, and moral laws of God. <span class="tei tei-q">“This is the
        love of God, that we keep his commandments.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another answer is,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“make it thy chief end to glorify
        God.”</span> Inasmuch as God's glory consists in the exhibition of
        his character as a benevolent being, all <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page158">[pg 158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> who promote his chief aim by making happiness
        according to his will, are living to glorify God.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another answer is,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“live a truly virtuous life.”</span> It has
        been shown that true virtue consists in <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">obedience to the
        great law of sacrifice</span></em> by which the lesser personal good
        is sacrificed to the greater good of all concerned.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus faith,
        repentance, love to God and man, making it our chief end to glorify
        God, living a virtuous life, all signify one and the same thing,
        (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,) choosing to find out and to
        obey all the physical, social, and moral laws of God as our chief end
        or ruling purpose.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">righteous</span></em>
        are those who have formed such a purpose, and who exhibit its results
        in their daily life.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wicked</span></em>
        are those who have not formed such a purpose, and do not exhibit it
        in their daily life.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the common
        language of every-day life, when a person is intensely interested in
        any pursuit, it is said to be <span class="tei tei-q">“his
        life.”</span> And when a man changes from a vicious to a virtuous
        course he is said to <span class="tei tei-q">“begin a new
        life.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus it would be
        in agreement with the ordinary use of language to call a new-formed
        purpose to obey all the laws of God the commencement of a new life.
        And as the beginning of natural life is the commencement of a life of
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">impulsive
        choices unregulated by law</span></em>, the commencement of a life of
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">obedience
        to law</span></em> would, by a figure of speech, very naturally be
        called <span class="tei tei-q">“a new birth.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have seen, in
        previous pages, that the formation of a ruling principle or governing
        purpose is sometimes the result of a slow process of educational
        influences, and sometimes it is a marked and sudden change. In
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159"
        id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the history of mind we find,
        as a general rule, that it is the slow process of educational
        training that secures a virtuous character in childhood, while the
        more sudden and marked changes are incident chiefly to more advanced
        life.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The term
        <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">regeneration</span></em>”</span> is used by
        theologians as meaning the formation of a ruling purpose to love and
        obey God, by man himself. By some, this change of mind is regarded as
        in all cases instantaneous, by others as sometimes a gradual and
        sometimes an instantaneous change.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The preceding
        still farther exhibits the fact that the whole foundation of religion
        and of morals rests on the answer to the question, what is <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">true
        virtue</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        Increases Moral Difficulties.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the preceding
        it appears that the more our race advances in civilization, the more
        numerous and complicated are the laws of God which must first be
        discovered and then obeyed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By advance in
        civilization is signified increase in the capacities of the human
        mind for varied enjoyments, and increase in the appropriate supply of
        these capacities. The early history of the race resembles the early
        period of individual life, when the chief enjoyments are those of the
        senses. The refined and varied pleasures of taste are but little
        attained except <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg
        160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> by
        cultivation. So also the higher pleasures of the intellect and of the
        moral nature are dependent on culture.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As every new
        avenue to enjoyment is opened, and every new capacity developed,
        there are inevitably resulting difficulties and temptations which,
        experience soon shows, must be regulated by laws and penalties. From
        this results the endless multitude of civil and statute laws, in
        addition to the various domestic and social rules enforced in the
        family, the school and the neighborhood.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All these laws and
        rules will be found to be only specific applications of the great law
        of sacrifice which demands that, in all cases, every mind shall
        choose what is best for self and best for the whole. The great
        democratic principle that the majority shall rule is but one mode of
        applying this general law of sacrifice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this aspect we
        can perceive how it is, that every attempt to develop any faculty of
        enjoyment in any created mind, and every effort to provide aliment
        for such developed capacities is right, as in agreement with the
        grand end designed by the Creator; provided it is done according to
        the great law of sacrifice disclosed by reason, viz., that individual
        enjoyment be made subordinate to the general good, and that no
        greater good be sacrificed for a less, either for self or for the
        commonwealth.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this light,
        music, drawing, painting, sculpture, architecture, the drama, poetry,
        laughter, all things that impart enjoyment to any mind are <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">right</span></em>,
        provided no higher good is sacrificed in enjoying them. Nay, more;
        all these modes of imparting enjoyment may <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a name="Pg161" id="Pg161" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> become positive duties, in cases where they do
        not interfere with some higher good.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This view of the
        subject still further illustrates the nature of that inability which
        exists in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">all</span></em> finite minds in discovering and
        obeying the laws of God.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are only two
        conceivable modes by which we can learn these laws; one is by the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">experience</span></em> of finite beings; the
        other is by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">revelation</span></em> from the Creator. To
        learn what is right and wrong by experience involves not only the
        certainty, but the necessity, as it respects the absolute right, of
        wrong-doing; for no one, however right the motive or intention may
        be, can discover what will cause more or less good or evil but by
        experiments in which the evil as well as the good is detected by
        experience.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To learn what is
        right and wrong in all the thousand and million complications of life
        by revelation, would involve the necessity of a direct revelation
        every hour of every day, to every individual of the race. But the
        only conceivable mode by which revelations from God are possible, is
        by miracles and prophecy, which are interruptions of the ordinary
        uniformity of nature. It is the fact that the laws of nature are
        uniform that alone makes miracles possible, so that incessant
        revelations by miracles would destroy such uniformity, and thus
        destroy the only conceivable mode of communication from the
        Creator.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This being so, the
        only possible method by which mankind can discover what is right and
        wrong in the greater portion of their actions is by an experience
        involving, more or less, wrong-doing as a part.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">general
        rules</span></em> of right and wrong which can be communicated both
        by God and man, but these <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg
        162]</span><a name="Pg162" id="Pg162" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        rules are to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">applied</span></em> by men to the numberless and
        ever-varying circumstances of life, involving still the same
        necessity of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">experience of evil</span></em> in order to
        detect the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">relative</span></em> amount of good to be gained
        in the varied courses offered for pursuit to which these rules are to
        be applied.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now the grand
        difficulty, as it respects both God and man, as before shown, is the
        positive inability of undeveloped mind to understand much of what is
        right and wrong. This difficulty meets the mature mind as really as
        it does the infant's; for while many of the general rules evolved by
        reason and experience are clear, and easily perceived, there are
        endless varieties of cases in which the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">application</span></em> of these rules is a
        matter of uncertainty. For example, that men are to be honest and
        speak the truth, are rules universally appreciated. But then come the
        questions whether this and that thing <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em>
        honest, or whether in this or that emergency it may not be right to
        say what is false. The higher men advance in civilization, and the
        more means and modes of enjoyment are discovered, the more
        complicated become the questions of right, and the more frequent the
        temptations to wrong.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All that can be
        done is to cultivate the conscience and train the reasoning powers of
        mankind, so that by means of the experience of life, as developed by
        individuals and communities, regard to the rules of right and wrong
        shall keep pace with the increasing civilization.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With these
        distinctions in the mind, we can perceive that <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sin</span></em>, in
        its widest sense, including transgression of <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unknown</span></em>

        limited sense, as transgression of <em class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So also we can
        see, that without the intervention of the Creator to teach us, it is
        an impossibility for any human being to live without sin; so that
        this intervention is impossible except to a limited extent, without
        an entire change in the eternal nature of things to which God's own
        will is conformed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have seen that
        we can learn what is right and wrong only by aid received from the
        experience of our fellow-beings around us.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But in order to
        this, there are certain virtues which are both difficult and
        indispensable. In studying the history of mind, it will be seen that
        the higher the grade of intellect and the greater its culture, the
        stronger is the love of intellectual supremacy and the more energetic
        the pride of opinion. It is a fact which none will dispute, that, as
        the general rule, having some exceptions, the class of minds most
        highly endowed by native talent and acquired culture, are most
        unwilling to take the attitude of <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">learners</span></em>
        toward their associates, and still more toward their inferiors in
        these endowments. When this pride of intellect and of opinion is
        combined with benevolence of disposition and with sensitiveness of
        conscience, there is nothing more difficult than to <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“become as a little child”</span> in learning truth and
        duty. For the more benevolence and conscientiousness, the greater the
        unwillingness to be put in the wrong.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And yet, in the
        smallest sphere of life, between every individual and his neighbors,
        thousands of questions of right and wrong turn on how our words and
        actions will affect the happiness of those around; and there is no
        possibility of settling such questions but by leaving every person at
        liberty to communicate freely what does, or does not, give them pain
        or pleasure, and thus teach others how to make happiness and save
        from pain. In order to this, it is indispensable that every one be
        made to understand that our chief aim is to make happiness the best
        and right way, and that for this end we wish to have a perfectly free
        expression of wishes and opinions. For if it is perceived that
        irritability and alienation result from such a course, all those
        around us will conceal their feelings and opinions, and thus, for
        want of a true knowledge of circumstances, we shall <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“walk in darkness,”</span> because we are not willing to
        be told the truths that put us in the wrong or expose our
        mistakes.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same free
        expression of opinion and protest against all wrong, are as
        indispensable to the discovery of those rules of right and wrong,
        that are to be evolved from the general experience. Every man, woman
        and child in the commonwealth, should be perfectly free to set forth
        their opinions, experience, and reasoning, for the purpose of finding
        out what is best for the whole. Nor should they be withheld by the
        fear that such a course would place a parent, a brother, a friend, or
        a party in the wrong, and expose those dearest to us to blame. For
        the true happiness of each and all is to be secured by a knowledge of
        the truth, and often such knowledge can be gained only by exposing
        the evil results of courses that are <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page165">[pg 165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> pursued by the best and most conscientious
        persons.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In carrying out
        this principle, there must be discretion exercised as to <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">time</span></em> and
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">manner</span></em> of performing the duty; and
        there are some <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">limitations</span></em> to be recognized, which
        are matters of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">expediency</span></em>. For example, a man must
        seek the best time to expose what is wrong, and he must seek to do it
        in a manner that will secure the good aimed at with the least
        possible evil. And if it can be done better by the agency of another,
        the aid of that other should be invoked.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So in regard to
        limitations, what is strictly personal should be confined to the
        party who alone is concerned. What relates solely to the family
        concerns should be confined to the family. Nor should any wrongs or
        dissensions be brought before the public except those in which the
        public welfare is involved.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But with these
        limitations it is the demand of reason and common sense, that every
        man, woman and child freely protest against all that they believe to
        be wrong in opinion or conduct.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In taking such a
        course, every man's success in discovering and propagating the truth
        will depend very much on the spirit with which it is attempted. If it
        is done in a self-sufficient, dictatorial, and denunciatory mode, the
        inevitable result will be to arouse those passions and prejudices
        which are most effectual in blinding the mind in discovering
        truth.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If, on the
        contrary, it is attempted with the humility, meekness and benevolence
        which are befitting ignorant, fallible and short-sighted beings,
        encompassed with such appalling difficulties and dangers, the most
        favorable of all influences will be exerted to secure a patient and
        candid attention.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Still, so
        sensitive are men to all implications of their motives or conduct, so
        unwilling are they to acknowledge themselves mistaken, that the
        faithful discharge of the duty of protesting against wrong, will
        always be attended with more or less of ill-will and bad
        passions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In view of the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been shown,
        that the more the capacities of men are cultivated, and the sources
        of enjoyment multiplied, the more complicated become the varying
        questions as to right and wrong moral action, and the more our
        reasoning powers and our conscience need to be cultivated in order to
        decide correctly.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Just as fast as
        men increase in the number and extent of the capacities and resources
        of enjoyment, will questions of right and wrong multiply, and rules
        be evolved, every one of which will rest on the grand law of
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sacrifice</span></em>, which demands of every
        individual that he shall give up private feelings and choose what is
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">best for
        all concerned</span></em>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These difficulties
        and complications are still more increased, if we are to take into
        account an immortal existence, and the influence which conduct and
        character in this life may have on a future eternity. What is best
        for each individual, and what is best for the commonwealth in such
        vast relations, involve questions far beyond the reach of human
        capacities, which only infinite wisdom can answer.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In all questions
        of right and wrong, for individual and for public interests, the
        degree of danger and risk involved, always is the ruling
        consideration. The greater the danger of the commonwealth, or of the
        individual, the greater are the demands for sacrifices <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg 168]</span><a name="Pg168" id="Pg168"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> on the part of all concerned. What would
        be right in circumstances of ease and safety, becomes the height of
        selfishness and crime in hours of peril and suffering.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To illustrate this
        point on a humble scale, let it be supposed that a vast and dangerous
        morass is filled with a multitude of travelers, of all ages and all
        degrees of intelligence, who can press through it to their homes only
        by difficult, dark, and circuitous paths. In addition to its
        morasses, pit-falls, swamps and fens, each path is beset with
        venomous reptiles, and its woods with ferocious beasts, while it is
        the young and tender who are the special objects of pursuit to these
        terrific foes. In such a community, and amid such dangers, all
        decisions of right and wrong, as to what was owed to others or to
        one's self, would be entirely diverse from what would be demanded
        were all in their safe homes. Sleepless nights, constant watching,
        painful toils, incessant vigilance, would be the imperious duty of
        every one, who could render any service. Amusements and sports, that
        in other circumstances would be wise and right, would be allowed only
        just so far as they tended to give relaxation or repose of mind and
        body to those who needed them, and only for the great end of securing
        a safe and speedy escape to all.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now suppose that,
        in these circumstances, some of the wanderers are taught that there
        were no such dangers, that the paths were all safe and certain, and
        that every one of them would sooner or later arrive safely at
        home.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Others are taught
        that there probably is some danger and some doubt as to the amount of
        risks, yet as <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg
        169]</span><a name="Pg169" id="Pg169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> no
        one knows much about the matter, on any alternative, it is very wise
        to be careful and prudent.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another class are
        taught that all these terrific dangers do exist; nay more, that it is
        certain that some are to be lost in pit-falls, some torn with wild
        beasts, some poisoned to death with venomous reptiles, and some for
        ever lost in bleak and cold morasses.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meantime, who
        should be the lost and who the saved, and the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">number</span></em> of
        the lost, would be entirely dependent on the care, vigilance, labors
        and sacrifices endured by each, not only for self, but for
        others.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It can easily be
        seen, that in these three classes there must be an entirely different
        standard for deciding all questions of right and wrong. What would be
        right and wise, in case there is little or no danger, would be folly
        and crime amid such terrific perils. In one case, each would have
        little concern or responsibility for any but self; in another case,
        all benevolent minds would be overwhelmed with anxiety for others as
        well as for themselves.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This being so, it
        is claimed that the deductions of reason as to the future immortality
        of man, and his risks and dangers beyond the grave, are indispensable
        to deciding multitudes of moral questions of the highest moment,
        while every person's standard of morality must be regulated by their
        decision of this question.</p>

        the Future Life.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been shown,
        that the teachings of reason as to the immortality of the soul, and
        our risks and dangers after death, are indispensable to a true
        standard of morality, and to the decision of innumerable moral
        questions of the highest moment.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next attempt,
        therefore, will be to set forth what can be learned by reason and
        experience, independently of revelation, in regard to the future
        destiny of man.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first question
        relates to the existence of the soul after death, and its
        immortality. Here we have to guide us that great principle of common
        sense, which regulates mankind in all the practical business of life,
        viz., <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">things are, and will continue according to past
        experience, until there is evidence of a change</span></em>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By the aid of
        this, we go forward in all practical affairs, believing that the
        beings and things around us are continued in existence till we have
        evidence that they are not. If any man were to talk and act as if
        every person was destroyed, and every town and village annihilated,
        as soon as the evidence of his senses failed, he would be deemed one
        who had <span class="tei tei-q">“lost his reason.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This same
        principle tends to the belief that the soul of man continues to exist
        after the dissolution of the body. We have <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no
        evidence</span></em> that the separation of soul and body is an event
        that either injures or destroys <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page171">[pg 171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the spiritual part. On the contrary, there are
        many analogies in nature that would lead to the impression that death
        gives new strength and powers to the disembodied spirit.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This being so, we
        have the same reason to believe that the soul of man exists after
        death as we have for believing that our friends are living when they
        leave us on a journey, and we have no evidence of their death. We can
        not see them, hear them, or feel them, and yet we believe they are
        living, we know not exactly where, because we have no evidence of
        their death. And so, after the dissolution of the body, though all
        evidence of sense as to the existence of their immaterial part
        ceases, we believe the same thinking, sentient spirits continue to
        exist, because we have no evidence that they have ceased to do
        so.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have perfect
        evidence that the body ceases to exist as a body, for it moulders to
        dust. We have no evidence at all that the soul is either injured or
        destroyed. Such a thing as the destruction or annihilation of a
        spirit was never known or heard of from any quarter of earth or
        heaven.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We therefore
        conclude, that at the moment of death the soul is still existing with
        all its powers unchanged.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same argument
        goes on still further, and leads to the immortality of the soul. We
        know of no cause or reason for the destruction of the soul at any
        future period. We never have known or heard that any soul ever ceased
        to exist. And so we infer, that the soul will keep on a perpetuated
        existence, by the same principle as that which leads us to believe
        the earth and the heavens will remain to future ages.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In regard to the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">character

        guide us. Without revelation, the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">past
        experience</span></em> of mind is our sole beacon to give light as to
        its future destiny.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our next inquiry,
        then, is, what does the past experience of mind teach us as to its
        condition beyond the grave? In pursuing this inquiry, we must recall,
        in brief forms, some of the points of mental experience set forth in
        previous chapters.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some of the most
        important of these relate to the principle of <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">habit</span></em> by
        which the exercise of all our faculties becomes more and more easy by
        use. This is true of the intellect, by which we gain our knowledge of
        what will secure <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">the most</span></em> happiness; of the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">social</span></em> nature, by which we give
        happiness to other minds and receive the same from them; of our
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">moral</span></em> nature, by which we are guided
        to justice, equity, and the rule of conscience; of our <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">voluntary</span></em>
        nature, by which we regulate all our other powers. Each and all are
        developed, strengthened, and facilitated in right action, by being
        exercised according to the laws of God.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The legitimate use
        of all our faculties induces also not only increased facility, but
        increased <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">enjoyment</span></em>. The more the intellect is
        trained, the more agreeable its exercise. The more our social nature
        is developed by use, the more its powers are developed and its
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">blessed</span></em> influence increased. The
        more our moral nature is exercised, the more vigorous becomes our
        sense of justice and the sensibilities of conscience, and the more
        pleasing their exercise. And the more the will is exercised in
        controlling every other faculty by the rules of rectitude, the more
        easy and delightful is this power of self-control.</p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span><a name="Pg173" id="Pg173"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The influence of
        habit in regard to the great law of <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sacrifice</span></em>
        for the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">best</span></em> good of all, is especially to
        be regarded. Such is its power that, in many cases, self-sacrifices
        that at first were annoying, or even painful, become sources of the
        highest and noblest enjoyment.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another not less
        important influence of habit is, in regard to those modes of
        enjoyment which are most important to the commonwealth, and most
        happifying. The pursuit of these increases both desire and capacity
        for gratification, while those less important and more dangerous, if
        made the leading object of pursuit, diminish capacity while desire is
        increased. Thus the happiness gained in giving and receiving
        affection, in causing happiness to others, and in rectitude of
        action, all increase both the desire and the capacity for these
        important and elevated modes of enjoyments. Nor is there any danger
        of excess in forming habits in these directions. But the pleasures of
        the senses and the pursuit of power, honor, and other enjoyments that
        terminate in self, are liable to excess, and this excess diminishes
        the capacity for enjoyment, while the ceaseless craving of desire
        remains.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus it appears
        that a mind that forms habits of happiness-making according to right
        rules, becomes more and more strongly drawn to that course by finding
        more and more enjoyment in it, while a mind that pursues as a chief
        end the enjoyments that terminate in self, constantly loses capacity
        for such good, and yet the desire for it drives on to vain and
        cheerless efforts.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another ominous
        fact in our mental nature is, the effect of habit in diminishing the
        control of the voluntary <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg
        174]</span><a name="Pg174" id="Pg174" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        power. When any excessive or illegitimate mode of exercising the
        faculties becomes a ruling passion, the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">change</span></em> of
        a habit thus formed becomes more and more difficult in exact
        proportion to the continuous repetition. Even when men see and feel
        that a habit is formed that increases their sorrow and diminishes
        their enjoyment, and that another course would render them every way
        nobler and happier, they find their purposes of change often are
        powerless. The control of the will continually yields to the force of
        habit, and so they are hopelessly driven on in their fetal
        pursuits.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, the effect
        of wrong action on the susceptibilities is as ominous as it is on the
        power of choice. We have seen that the design of painful emotions is
        to stimulate to the formation of good habits, and that when this
        legitimate object is not effected these emotions continually decrease
        in strength and vividness, so that the designed benefit is lost. Thus
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">fear</span></em> is designed to induce habits of
        caution, but if no such habits are the result, danger ceases to
        excite this emotion, and a man becomes at once fearless and careless.
        So with sympathy in the sufferings of others; if no habits of
        benevolent efforts to relieve are induced, that sensibility
        diminishes, and men become at once unsympathising, hard and cruel. So
        it is with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">shame</span></em>; if it does not lead to habits
        of honor and duty, the susceptibility continually diminishes. And so
        it is with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">remorse</span></em>; if habits of rectitude are
        not induced by its emotions, the conscience becomes <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“seared as with hot iron.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the most
        deteriorating effect of wrong action is seen in regard to that
        fundamental point of the mental constitution which makes it a source
        of happiness to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg
        175]</span><a name="Pg175" id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> be
        the cause of happiness to others. It is a universal fact that the
        tendency of disagreeable emotions is to lead to the infliction of
        pain on others. This propensity to inflict pain on whoever is the
        cause of pain, when regulated by the rules of rectitude, is the
        source of justice in the family and state, and leads only to good.
        But when it is indulged and unregulated, it is the most fearful
        feature in our mental constitution. The records of history exhibit
        many monsters of our race, whose mental constitution has become so
        disordered by habits of fatal indulgence, that all love of
        happiness-making for others seems destroyed, and the baleful pleasure
        of tormenting becomes a ruling passion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another feature of
        our mental conformation which directly bears on this subject, is the
        fact, that all those good qualities and benevolent acts which
        naturally tend to please and awaken the desire of good to others, may
        become sources of pain and ill-will. This is the case when the lovely
        and benevolent traits of other minds are contrasted with opposite
        traits in self. Thus it is that the selfish, cruel and malignant hate
        and are powerfully repelled from the generous, just and virtuous,
        while the good as instinctively fly from the wicked.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The natural result
        of these features in the nature of mind, is a continual tendency
        toward a separation of the good and the bad, the righteous and the
        wicked.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to the
        teachings of experience, a mind that forms habits of selfishness and
        sin is constantly tending to a deterioration of its nature in all
        directions. And the course of obedience to the grand law of
        self-sacrifice for the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">best</span></em> good of all, becomes more
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a name="Pg176"
        id="Pg176" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and more difficult and
        improbable. As the natural result the good are more and more
        attracted toward each other, and the bad are more and more
        repelled.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These tendencies,
        so plainly exhibited here, reasoning from experience, we infer are to
        continue after death, until the final result must be the entire
        exclusion of the evil from the good, whenever power exists to compel
        the separation. This power, all must feel is held and will be
        exercised by the Author of all minds, whose great plan, so far as
        reason teaches, can be carried to perfection only by such a
        consummation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One point in the
        history of our race has a mournful pertinence to this question. We
        find that the improvement and the safety of the great commonwealth is
        always, more or less, promoted by the ruin of individuals. Multitudes
        are deterred from evil courses by the miserable end of those who
        pursue them; so that the good are often preserved by the destruction
        of the bad.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So, too, we find
        exhibitions of the fact that minds are utterly ruined, and ruined
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for
        ever</span></em>, so far as we can perceive. The man who has
        stultified his intellect, ruined his health, seared his conscience,
        and blunted all his generous and benevolent sensibilities by a course
        of debauchery, cruelty and crime, is a wreck as total and
        irretrievable, so far as we can see, as a watch whose springs and
        pivots are crushed beneath the hammer, or a human body whose every
        lineament is effaced beneath the rushing locomotive train.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The common
        language of life expresses such mental facts in precisely the same
        terms as are applied to physical catastrophes. Thus, a man who is
        given <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a name=
        "Pg177" id="Pg177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> up to debauchery,
        intemperance and crime, is said to be a <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“total wreck”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“entirely
        destroyed,”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“utterly
        ruined.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Add to this the
        teaching of experience, that when men are bad, the increase of
        blessings only increases indulgence and crime. At the same time
        punishment does not tend to reformation. The more men suffer for
        their folly and guilt, the more hardened they become. The victims of
        licentiousness and intemperance, though they suffer such miseries,
        have ever been regarded as the farthest removed from the
        probabilities of reformation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Add to all this,
        the deductions of reason as to the moral nature of the Creator and
        Governor of all minds. He has power to separate the good and bad; his
        great design, of which we here see only the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">tendencies</span></em>, makes it indispensable
        to the perfect happiness of the good that they be separated from the
        bad—a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">perfectly</span></em> happy commonwealth can not
        be attained where the bad form a part—while the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sense of
        justice</span></em> exists in God on a scale far above ours,
        demanding <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">added</span></em> penalties for the known and
        willful destruction of happiness. He, like his children on earth,
        feels that craving for retributive justice, which can never rest till
        the guilty and remorseless monster receives the just recompense for
        his cruelty and crimes.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These teachings of
        reason and experience lead to the conclusion, not only that there is
        to be a grand consummation in which all sin and suffering shall be
        ended in a perfected commonwealth, but also to the conclusion that
        those excluded from this community of the good are to continue their
        existence in sin and its natural results for ever.</p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That any portion,
        either of matter or mind, is to be annihilated, can not be inferred
        from any past experience. All that we can learn are the laws of
        perpetual <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">succession</span></em> and <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">change</span></em>.
        One single fact of annihilation has never yet been made known to man
        by any process of reasoning, or any recorded experience.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is another
        question in reference to this awful subject, which is of deepest
        interest. Although the deductions of reason lead to the doctrine of
        the eventual separation of mankind into two distinct communities, the
        good and the evil, what are its teachings as to the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">immediate</span></em>
        state of each individual soul after the event of death?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here, as before,
        we have only the nature and past history of mind, from which the
        future is to be deduced. In this world we have found the changes in
        the character of individuals and of communities to proceed by slow
        and imperceptible movement. We have nothing in the past to lead to
        the belief that this slow process of discipline, culture and change
        may not proceed on for ages. As in this life, multitudes have the
        impress and direction of character given in early life, so that the
        first few years determine all their future history in this world, so
        the career of this short life may fix the future through eternal
        years. And yet the process of change to the full consummation of
        character may involve ages.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In studying the
        works of the Creator, we find that every thing goes forward on a
        system of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">developments</span></em>. Nothing comes into
        being in full perfection, and unless there is an interruption of the
        natural tendencies of things, every thing reaches its full and
        perfected state before its existence ends. And the nobler, larger,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span><a name="Pg179"
        id="Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and grander the existence, the
        slower it proceeds to its consummated perfection. The oak and the
        palm demand centuries ere they reach their perfected prime. The
        highest grades of animal life are slowest in gaining their full
        development. The horse, the elephant, and the camel, are going
        forward to perfection for years after the feebler tribes that started
        with them have perfected and perished.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Guided, then, by
        the analogies of experience, we should infer that <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mind</span></em>, the
        noblest work of its Creator's hand—mind, that begins its career in
        such low and feeble development, is not to form the mournful
        exception to the general rule.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the contrary,
        we infer from all past experience, both of matter and mind, that the
        soul, when it lays aside its outer covering, proceeds onward in its
        career of development. And if its period of progressive development
        is proportioned to its relative value in comparison with all other
        created things, the fleeting years of this life in relation to the
        ages previous to its prime, may be but as the first days of puling
        infancy to the whole career of manhood.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But this subject
        is imperfectly treated, if we neglect to consider the fact, that the
        soul, so far as we can perceive, is <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">disembodied</span></em> at death. We have
        perfect evidence, that the material part is destroyed, as to its
        organized existence. We have the same sort of evidence that the soul
        continues to exist, and will continue to exist, as we have that the
        sun exists when all evidence of sight ceases. But what is the
        experience of a disembodied spirit, we have no means of learning. It
        may be that its powers of knowledge and action are greatly increased,
        when freed from its earthly prison. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> If this be so, the experience of this life
        leads to the inference that its dangers and temptations are increased
        in exact proportion. Increase of civilization is only increase in
        sources of knowledge and enjoyment, and each addition brings new
        temptations, new rules, and the need of new penalties. It may be the
        same in the future life.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We can suppose the
        body a veil to hide our mind from another, and that death makes every
        soul <span class="tei tei-q">“open and naked,”</span> in all its
        thoughts and feelings, to every other disembodied spirit. What would
        be the effect of such a revelation, no one could say. But we should
        fear rather than hope.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If men are
        exasperated by words that exhibit only a portion of the scorn,
        contempt, and disgust felt toward the base and mean, not only by the
        pure and good, but by the wicked themselves, such a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">full revelation of
        all minds to all minds</span></em> presents a theme for awful
        forebodings to the guilty. And even the purest might tremble to
        encounter such an ordeal. But over such terrific conjectures rest the
        darkness and silence of the grave.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The following,
        then, are the deductions of reason and experience as to the future
        condition of our race after death.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The soul, at the
        dissolution of the body, remains unchanged in its tastes, habits and
        character. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">tendencies</span></em> indicated in this life
        are continued indefinitely, and eventually will result in the
        separation of the good and the bad into two separate communities, the
        one, being obedient to all the laws of God, will be for ever and
        perfectly happy, and the other are to reap the natural results of
        disobedience, and whatever <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg
        181]</span><a name="Pg181" id="Pg181" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        added penalties the best good of the universe may demand.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The final
        consummation in which this separation will be achieved, may be at the
        distance of ages, and in the meantime all those minds that have
        passed, or will pass from this life, are in the same process of
        culture, discipline, and upward or downward progress, which exists in
        this life. Whether these advantages and temptations will be greater
        or less in the disembodied state, we have no data for inference or
        conjecture.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The conduct and
        character formed in this life will have an abiding influence on the
        character and happiness of every mind through eternal ages.<a id=

        <span style="font-size: 173%">Chapter XXIX. What Must We Do To Be
        Saved?</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have considered
        the risks and dangers of the future state, as taught by reason and
        experience, and also as the foundation of a true standard of
        morality. We have seen that the true mode of escape from these
        dangers is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">the formation of a truly virtuous
        character</span></em>, or in other words, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">it is making it our
        chief end to obey all the laws of God</span></em>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next question
        is, what are the teachings of reason and experience as to the most
        successful modes of securing true virtue, or voluntary obedience to
        all the laws of God?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This brings up the
        inquiry as to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">causes</span></em> of voluntary <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg 182]</span><a name="Pg182" id="Pg182"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> action, and of the power which one mind
        has of securing right or wrong volitions in another.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In a previous
        chapter was pointed out the distinction to be recognized between the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">producing</span></em> cause and the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">occasional</span></em> causes of volition.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mind itself is the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">only</span></em> producing cause of its own
        volitions. Excited desires, and those objects which excite desire,
        are the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">occasional</span></em> causes of choice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The question is,
        in what sense can any being be the cause of virtuous actions, or
        virtuous character, in another mind?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here we must recur
        to the fact that the Creator, as the author of all minds, and of all
        the things that excite desire, is the cause, in one sense, of all the
        volitions and of all the characters of all finite minds. It is in
        this sense that, in the Bible, the Jehovah of the Old Testament says,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I make peace and <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">create
        evil</span></em>.”</span> No other being but the Creator can be
        regarded as the cause of volitions in this sense, viz., as the author
        of all minds and their circumstances of temptation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is a second
        sense in which the Creator is never the cause of sinful action in any
        mind. It is this: creating or modifying our susceptibilities, or
        arranging temptations with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">the design</span></em> or <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intention</span></em>
        of producing sinful action. This is established by proving, that the
        chief end of God is to make the most possible happiness, and that sin
        is the needless destruction of happiness, resulting from disobedience
        to the laws of God.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The only sense,
        then, in which God can be called the author or cause of sinful
        volitions in the minds of his creatures, is the fact that he is the
        author of all created minds and of their circumstances of
        temptation.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg
        183]</span><a name="Pg183" id="Pg183" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In regard to man,
        there are only two conceivable modes, in which he can be the cause of
        sinful or virtuous character in other minds.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first mode is
        so to combine circumstances of temptation as to affect the most
        excitable and powerful sensibilities, or to remove those objects and
        influences that sustain moral principle, or by a long course of
        training, to form habits and induce principles. The combinations of
        motive influences that one mind can thus bring to bear on another, as
        temptations to right or wrong action, are almost infinite.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another mode is by
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">changing
        the constitutional susceptibilities</span></em>. This can sometimes
        be effected to a certain degree by education, and the formation of
        habits. It can be still more directly effected through the physical
        organization. For example, a child may be trained to use coffee, tea,
        alcohol, or tobacco, till the nervous system is shattered, and then a
        placid temper becomes excitable, an active nature becomes indolent,
        and multitudes of other disastrous changes are the result.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When these two
        modes are employed with the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">design</span></em> to induce wrong action, then
        men are blameable causes of sinful action and character in their
        fellow men. God, as above shown, never thus causes sin. When these
        modes are employed with the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">intention</span></em> to induce virtuous actions
        and character, then both God and man are causes of right moral action
        in mankind.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, it appears,
        that in the formation of virtuous character and habits, God,
        educators and self are the three combining causes, each being
        indispensable to the result, and thus each dependent on the others.
        God decides the nature and combinations of our susceptibilities
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg 184]</span><a name="Pg184"
        id="Pg184" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and our circumstances of
        temptation. The educators of mind also modify the susceptibilities,
        and regulate the temptations. Self, as the producing cause of
        volition, decides the nature of our own volitions, and thus also
        coöperates to regulate circumstances of temptation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The attainment of
        virtuous character, therefore, depends conjointly on God, man and
        self. It has been shown that God <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">invariably</span></em>
        does <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
        best he can</span></em> to secure the most perfect action possible in
        all minds.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The blamable
        causes of all failure in right and virtuous action are self and the
        finite educators of self. The unblamable causes are God, educators
        and self, so far as they are faithful in doing <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all they
        can</span></em> to educate aright.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With these
        preliminary considerations, we proceed in the inquiry as to those
        modes which in past experience have been found most successful in
        securing virtuous character, or voluntary obedience to the laws of
        God.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first cause of
        right moral action is a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">knowledge</span></em> of and <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">faith</span></em> in
        the physical, social, intellectual and moral laws of God. It is
        impossible, in the nature of things, that a new-created mind should
        be possessed of such knowledge and faith. All that is possible, so
        far as we can learn by reason and experience, is that there should be
        a slow and gradual development not only of each individual mind, but
        of the whole race, as each generation, in turn, receives by
        instruction the experience of the one previous, and transmits it with
        its own experience to a succeeding generation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next thing
        that has been found efficacious in forming virtuous character is the
        formation of uniform <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">habits of obedience to parental
        rule</span></em>, in the early periods <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page185">[pg 185]</span><a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> of existence. To secure this, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">invariable steadiness
        in government</span></em> has been found indispensable. If a child
        finds that sometimes he is to obey and sometimes he is not, there is
        always a temptation to struggle against law. But if a parent's laws,
        rewards and penalties are as steady and sure as those of God, in due
        time the child submits as cheerfully to the domestic rules and
        commands, as he does to the laws of nature. He is no more tempted to
        contest parental commands than he is to attempt to stop the flow of a
        river or the falling of rain. In this way a habit of submission to
        law is generated, which makes all the future discipline and training
        of life comparatively easy. A child learns cheerfully to obey a
        heavenly Father, just in proportion as he thus obeys his earthly
        parents.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next thing
        taught by experience is that children should be instructed as fast as
        possible in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">reasonableness and benevolence</span></em> of
        all the laws they are required to obey. Obedience is made easy and
        sure just in proportion as a child is made to perceive, that such
        obedience is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">best for himself and best for all
        concerned</span></em>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next thing
        which experience has shown to be most effective in securing obedience
        to law, is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">love</span></em> on the part of the educator,
        and corresponding love in return from the child. To gain the love of
        a child an educator must exhibit all lovable traits, and confer
        benefits, so as to call forth at once admiration, gratitude and
        affection. This renders it easy to the child to conform to the rules
        and wishes of one so beloved.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sympathy with a
        child in all its trials and in all its enjoyments, still further
        increases this power of another mind in right
        guidance.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg
        186]</span><a name="Pg186" id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This sympathetic
        influence is greatly increased by the power of a virtuous <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">example</span></em>—especially if this example
        is exhibited by a beloved friend and benefactor, who would be
        gratified by thus guiding a dependent mind.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another influence
        that tends to secure virtuous action is the bearing of pain and
        hardships even when it is not voluntary. Those children who are
        trained in a cold clime and on a hard soil, and who are early trained
        to hardships, find it far easier to conform to rule, and to bear
        sacrifices for the general good, than those whose lives have been a
        course of uninterrupted ease and indulgence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To these, add the
        social influences of the example and sympathy of a surrounding
        community. Where all around are practicing virtuous conduct—where all
        admire and praise only what is good and right—it is far easier to
        secure obedience to the rules of rectitude, than where the example
        and sympathy of surrounding minds are opposed to virtue.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the most
        powerful of all influences in securing virtuous action, is the
        principle of love and gratitude toward some noble benefactor, who
        saves from some terrible evils at the expense of great personal
        suffering and sacrifices, and who seeks his reward in the pleasure of
        redeeming those thus benefited, from the snares and ruin of sin. And
        the greater the evils averted, and the more severe the suffering on
        the part of the benefactor, the stronger the influence thus gained to
        secure virtuous character and action in the one thus rescued.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These are the
        influences which experience has <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page187">[pg 187]</span><a name="Pg187" id="Pg187" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> shown to be most effective in securing virtuous
        character.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the question
        is asked, <span class="tei tei-q">“What must <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">we</span></em> do to
        be saved?”</span> it may be answered in reference to all concerned in
        the matter; that is to say, <span class="tei tei-q">“What must self
        do—What must our fellow-men do—What must the Creator do, to secure
        obedience to his laws, and thus to save from sin and its
        penalties?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In view of the
        above teachings, each one for himself must seek, first, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knowledge</span></em>
        of the laws of God, and of their rewards and penalties as discovered
        by the experience of mankind. In order to do this, each must take all
        means to gain <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">true</span></em> teachers, and to receive their
        teachings in true <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">faith</span></em>, that is, that <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">practical</span></em>
        faith, which includes the purpose of obedience. Each must cultivate
        the intellect, the reason and the moral sense, in order to judge
        correctly in receiving and applying the rules of rectitude; each must
        seek to discover the reasonableness and benevolence of these laws,
        and form <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">habits</span></em> of steady obedience; each
        must seek to discover and rightly to appreciate all the good and
        lovable qualities of all who institute and administer laws, from the
        Creator to all subordinate rulers and governors in the domestic and
        civil state; each must seek the society of those whose sympathy and
        example would encourage and promote virtuous conduct; and finally,
        each must make obedience to all the laws of God the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">chief end</span></em>
        or ruling purpose. These are briefly the reply to the great question
        in relation to self.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We are next to
        consider this question in relation to what men must do to <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">save
        others</span></em>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here we are to
        take into account two subjects previously <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> illustrated; the first is that great law of
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sacrifice</span></em>, by which each individual
        must make his own wishes and welfare subordinate to the higher
        interests of the great commonwealth; the second is the fact that all
        questions of right and wrong are dependent on the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">risks and
        dangers</span></em> that threaten the commonwealth. In cases where
        there is little peril or evil, each individual has little
        responsibility for others. On the contrary, when all are exposed to
        terrific dangers and hazards, every individual is bound to think and
        care as much for the danger of each one as for his own. And just as
        much as the interests of all are of more value than those of one, so
        much <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">more</span></em> should each place the public
        welfare above that of self.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In a preceding
        chapter have been exhibited the risks and dangers of our race in
        reference to the future life. These are such, that without any appeal
        to revelation, every man of humanity and benevolence must feel that
        to save his fellow-beings from such dangers should become immediately
        his leading object of pursuit, his <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">chief
        end</span></em>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In pursuing this
        as the main object of life, each individual is bound to follow the
        teachings of experience as to the most successful modes as set forth
        above. Each one, then, should become a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">teacher of the laws
        of God</span></em> to all who are in ignorance, to the full extent of
        his power, and set forth all the motives to induce obedience; each
        should strive to exhibit all those qualities and deeds which will
        excite admiration, love and gratitude, in order thus to gain
        influence over other minds and guide them to virtuous conduct. Each
        should confer benefits and practice self-denying benevolence toward
        others and thus gain still farther <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page189">[pg 189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> influence. Each should strive to exhibit that
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">example</span></em> and that <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sympathy</span></em>
        that are so effective in leading others aright.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In regard to those
        who are the educators of the young, each must strive to maintain that
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">invariable
        steadiness in governments</span></em> which is so effective in
        forming virtuous habits and in rendering obedience to the laws of God
        more and more easy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Finally, it should
        be the aim of each to establish such a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">community</span></em>
        around all who are being trained to virtue, that every social
        influence shall repress vice and encourage virtue.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next, we are to
        consider the great question in reference to the Creator. What then
        must God do to save our race from sin and its miseries? What would
        reason and experience teach us to expect he would do to secure
        obedience to his laws?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In answering this
        question we must again refer to the causes which experience has shown
        to be most effective, for we can conceive of no other. We have
        examined the evidence that the Creator has given to each of his
        children such a constitution of mind and body, and such circumstances
        of temptation and trial as is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">best on the whole</span></em>, as a part of an
        infinite <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">system</span></em> whose results are to develop
        through eternity. At the same time it has been shown that God is
        limited, by the eternal nature of things, to a course in which
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">some</span></em> evil must exist, so that all
        that is requisite to his character as perfectly benevolent, is that
        this evil should be reduced by him to its least possible amount.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To suppose that
        God can impart at creation of each mind all the knowledge of the

        190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> for
        all the myriads of new relations, of myriads of beings through all
        eternity, is to suppose an impossibility in the nature of things.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If it be
        maintained that the Creator is not thus limited by the nature of
        things, but, as theologians teach, could make mind perfect in all
        needed knowledge as in all other respects, at the first, then we have
        the greater contradiction involved in the fact, that a perfectly
        benevolent being chose for his children ignorance and sin in
        preference to knowledge and virtue.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To say that it may
        be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">best</span></em> to create minds destitute of
        all needed knowledge when the want insures infinite wrong and
        suffering, and when there is power to create the knowledge that would
        insure perfect happiness, is simply a direct contradiction. It is
        saying that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">less</span></em> happiness may be <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">greater</span></em>
        than <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">greater</span></em> happiness. For by
        <span class="tei tei-q">“what is for the best”</span> we understand
        <span class="tei tei-q">“that which secures the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">most</span></em>
        happiness.”</span> And saying that making misery where there is power
        to make happiness in its place, is <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">best</span></em>,
        means nothing else but the assertion above, that less happiness is
        greater than greater happiness; or that <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">less</span></em> is
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">more</span></em> than <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">most</span></em>,
        which is a contradiction, inconceivable and absurd, so that no mind
        can either comprehend or believe it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, every
        theologian of every school and of every sect maintains that
        <span class="tei tei-q">“God does all things <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for the
        best</span></em>.”</span> Every one who believes in a benevolent
        Creator does the same. This is simply saying that God does the best
        possible; that is to say, there is no power that can make a better
        system than God has made, or administer it with more wisdom or
        benevolence. He has chosen the best possible and so he can not do any
        better.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg
        191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These things being
        granted, the teachings of experience would lead us to suppose, still
        farther, that the Creator must do all that is possible to maintain
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">invariable
        steadiness of government</span></em>. We can see that this, which is
        so important in family government, must be still more so in an
        infinite family. For this end, the natural penalties for wrong doing,
        must be as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">invariable</span></em> as the rewards for well
        doing.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, the Creator
        must instruct his creatures in his laws and their rewards and
        penalties to the full extent of his power. That is to say, he must
        provide well-trained educators of mind, as fast and as fully as is
        possible in the nature of things, having in view the results of
        eternal ages to guide his decisions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, to secure
        voluntary obedience, he must add to the natural rewards and penalties
        of his laws, the other class of motives which experience has shown to
        be most effective. Thus, he must present himself to his creatures as
        a being possessing all those qualities which call forth the
        delightful emotions of admiration, reverence and love; he must show
        himself as a constant benefactor, and as one who <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“does not willingly afflict or grieve the children of
        men.”</span> He must manifest his love to his creatures by word as
        well as by deed. He must come personally to provide for their wants
        and cheer them with his care. He must show his tenderness and
        sympathy in their trials and sorrows as well as in their joys. And if
        they are exposed to great dangers and evils from which they can be
        redeemed by self-sacrifice and suffering on his part, this highest
        and most effective proof of love must be exhibited.<a id="noteref_11"
        name="noteref_11" href="#note_11"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To this must be
        added, a manifestation of his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">chief</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        "font-style: italic">desire</span></em>, so that when love and
        gratitude ask, what can we do to please our benefactor in return, the
        answer shall be, obey his laws, and work and suffer for the good of
        all, as you see your Heavenly Parent does for you.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Finally, he must
        bring around each of his creatures the powerful social influence, not
        only of his own sympathy and example, but those also of a perfect
        commonwealth, where all shall be perfect as is the Father of all.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is what we
        should evolve by the light of reason and experience, as what the
        Creator must do to save our race. Whether he has done all this, is a
        question that belongs to that system of religion which we can gain
        only by revelation from God.<a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12"

        Experience are Sufficient Without Revelation.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The preceding
        chapters present the system of natural religion, as it may be gained
        by experience and those principles of reason or common sense with
        which all men are endowed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whether mankind
        ever have, or ever would, fully evolve this system of religious
        belief without any aid by revelation from the Creator, is a question
        which we can not readily decide—inasmuch as the claim of Christianity
        is, that from the first, our race have been instructed by revelations
        from God, which have been more or less preserved in traditions and
        written records. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page193">[pg
        193]</span><a name="Pg193" id="Pg193" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> It
        is certain that the elimination of this system, by unaided humanity,
        is dependent on the development of both the intellectual and moral
        powers, just as much so, as the physical discoveries of Newton,
        Copernicus and Columbus were dependent on the intellectual progress
        of the race.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In reference to
        the question of the necessity or importance of revelations from the
        Creator, it is interesting to examine how far those nations that have
        been most advanced in intellectual development, have secured this
        system of common sense, independently of the revelations contained in
        the Bible—revelations which also have been more or less incorporated
        by Mohammed into the Koran.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In a brief review
        of the pagan systems, that of Boodhism occupies the first place, as
        one which has had longest and largest control over civilized
        pagandom—one which has been most unimpeded by resistance, and one
        which now controls <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">one half</span></em> the human race.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have seen that
        the common-sense system teaches an eternally self-existent Creator,
        perfect in knowledge, wisdom, power and benevolence, administering a
        perfect system by laws—his chief design being to produce the most
        possible happiness with the least possible evil. It teaches also,
        that the right <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">voluntary</span></em> action of mind, as a part
        of this system, consists in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">good willing</span></em> toward the Creator,
        toward self, and toward our fellow-beings, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">according to the
        laws</span></em> of God, so as to secure what is <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">best</span></em> for
        all concerned—making it imperative that self be made subordinate to
        the public good. It teaches also, that the most effective mode of
        securing this right action is, first, by imparting <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span><a name="Pg194" id="Pg194"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">knowledge</span></em> of these laws and their
        sanctions, and thus influencing mind by the motives of <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hope</span></em> and
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">fear</span></em>; next, by the motive influences
        of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">love</span></em>, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=

        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sympathy</span></em>
        and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">example</span></em>, as mutually exercised by
        God, our fellow-men and self. Finally, it teaches that all questions
        as to what is right and wrong, are to be regulated with reference to
        the risks and dangers of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">future life</span></em>, and not with chief
        reference to this life alone—and that in this estimate the interests
        of self are to be made subordinate to those of the commonwealth.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We will now notice
        how far the system of Boodh corresponds with that of common
        sense.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This
        religion<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href=
        "#note_13"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a> is one
        in which there is no intervention of any supreme God, or any
        self-existent being, or any Creator; on the contrary, all souls and
        all the universe exist from eternity. All souls from eternity have
        gone on transmigrating from one body to another, rising or falling in
        the scale of existence according to their merit or demerit. Boodh is
        a general name for a divinity or god. There have been innumerable
        Boodhs in different worlds and different ages, but in this world only
        four. These four are beings who have risen by merit through various
        transmigrations, and then became incarnate in human bodies. At last
        they were annihilated, none of them being now in existence—so that
        this world for centuries has been without any God.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The last Boodh of
        this world was Gaudama. He passed through innumerable transmigrations
        in four hundred millions of worlds, and attained immense merit. At
        last, he was born into this world the son of a king, about six
        hundred years before Christ. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page195">[pg 195]</span><a name="Pg195" id="Pg195" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> The moment he was born he exclaimed,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Now am I the noblest of men; this is the
        last time I shall ever be born!”</span> He remained forty-five years
        as Boodh of this world—performed all sorts of meritorious deeds,
        promulgated excellent laws, and then was annihilated. Ever since,
        this world has had no God, and will have none for eight thousand
        years, when the next Boodh is to appear. The first three Boodhs left
        no laws or sayings. Those of Gaudama, the last Boodh, were reduced to
        writing A. D. 94, and these are the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bedegat</span></span>,
        or Bible of the Boodhists.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These teachings of
        Gaudama are so obligatory, that disbelief of them is the only crime
        that incurs <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">eternal</span></em> punishment.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to this
        system, true virtue or rewardable merit, consists in obeying the
        teachings of Gaudama. These teachings relate first to sins to be
        avoided. The five general laws are, not to kill, not to steal, not to
        commit adultery, not to lie, and not to drink intoxicating liquors.
        These are subdivided so as to include all sins of similar kinds under
        each head. For example, the first law includes even the killing of
        animals for food, also capital punishments and war.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sins are divided
        into these three classes: first, those of the body, such as killing,
        theft, fornication, etc.; those of the tongue, as falsehood, harsh
        language, idle talk, etc.; and those of the mind, as pride,
        covetousness, envy, heretical thoughts, etc.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These writings of
        Gaudama strongly denounce the evils of pride, anger, covetousness,
        and all inordinate appetites. Men are exhorted to avoid excess in
        perfumes, ornaments and laughter—also strong drink, smoking, opium,
        night wanderings, bad company, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page196">[pg 196]</span><a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> idleness, anger under abuse, flattery to
        benefactors, annoying jests, and all that leads to strife.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For all such sins
        the most awful conceivable punishments are to follow in a future
        state, and for millions of ages.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Rewardable merit
        is of three kinds:</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1. Obedience to
        all the preceding precepts and prohibitions, and the performance of
        all duties <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">fairly deducible</span></em> from them, such as
        integrity, gentleness, lenity, forbearance, condescension, veneration
        to parents and love to mankind in general.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. Alms-giving and
        votive offerings. This includes feeding priests, building temples and
        accommodations for priests and for travelers, making roads, tanks and
        wells, planting fruit and shade trees, feeding criminals and animals,
        and finally, giving alms to all classes of men in need.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. Prayers and
        reading the Bedegat, or religious books. Of this last kind of merit,
        there are three kinds: the first is the senseless repetition of
        prayers and reading; the second, reading intelligently; the last, is
        performing these exercises with strong desires and feelings. Prayers
        are not addressed to any God, as there is none existing now for this
        world. Gaudama, at his death, advised that, in addition to obeying
        his laws, his relics and image should be worshiped, and temples be
        built to his honor till the next Boodh came.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Votive offerings
        of fruit, rice and flowers are made to priests or placed in temples.
        The prayers consist of the repetition of soliloquies that express our
        liability to bodily evils and to mental suffering, and our inability
        to escape. Also of protestations of this kind, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“I will not
        lie;”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“I will not steal;”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I will not kill,”</span> etc.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are four
        Sabbaths or days for public worship each month, when the people go
        with votive offerings and prayers to the temple of Gaudama, but they
        have no general united worship.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Boodhists have
        a hierarchy very much like the Catholic church, with varied grades
        and ranks. The priests are required to practice celibacy, and are
        mainly supported by voluntary gifts from the people.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They reside in
        buildings erected especially for them, and as celibacy and the
        avoidance of women are enjoined on all, these establishments very
        much resemble Catholic monasteries. Few of the priests preach, and
        only by special request, after which, presents are made to them. They
        attend funerals only when invited, and then expect presents. Part of
        them spend some time in teaching novitiate priests, but most of them,
        regarding work as unprofessional, spend their time in sheer idleness.
        It is the rule that each priest perambulate the streets every morning
        till he receives boiled rice enough for his daily wants. The higher
        class of priests avoid this. In Burmah the priests are at the rate of
        one to every thirty persons, and they are well supported by the
        people, and without interference from the government to enforce
        it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As to the motives
        that sustain this religion, there being no God to the Boodhist, all
        motives arising from relations and regard to him are excluded. All
        the motives presented appeal to hope of good and fear of evil to
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">self</span></em>. Those who attain a certain
        measure of merit in obeying Gaudama's teachings go to some of the
        celestial regions, according to their attainments. <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> These consist of twenty-six heavens, one
        above another, which offer various degrees of enjoyment according to
        merit obtained.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are eight
        principal hells; four that torment with cold and four with heat. In
        the other hells are other sufferings, although not connected with
        heat and cold. Worms bite, bowels are torn out, limbs are racked,
        bodies are lacerated, they are pierced with hot spits, crucified head
        downward, gnawed by dogs, torn by vultures. These are described with
        minuteness in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Bedegat</span></span> and often depicted by the
        native artists in drawings, reminding one of Dante's Inferno
        illustrated.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For killing a
        parent or a priest a man will suffer in one of the hells of fire for
        inconceivable millions of ages. Denying the doctrines of Gaudama
        incurs <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The souls of all
        the universe have existed from eternity, transmigrating for ever, and
        thus rising and falling in the scale of existence according to the
        degrees of merit at each birth. This is decided not by any deity but
        by immutable fate. In passing through these changes the amount of
        sorrow is incalculable. The Bedegat declares that the tears shed by
        one soul in its various changes are so great that the ocean in
        comparison is but a drop. Sorrow is declared to be the inevitable
        attendant of all existence, and therefore <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the chief end,”</span> and the highest reward of
        Boodhism is, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The system of
        Boodhism commenced about six hundred years before Christ, and has
        pervaded eastern, central and southern Asia about as long and as
        fully as Christianity has pervaded Europe. The Burman empire, where
        this account of that faith was obtained, presents the most favorable
        results of this system on the character and condition of its
        votaries.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In China, Buddhism
        (another name for Boodhism) is the popular religion. With it is
        associated Confucianism, which is a system of morals and politics
        instituted by Confucius, B. C. 550, which teaches nothing in regard
        to any God or a future state. With them co-exist the sect of Laotze,
        which is a kind of rationalism. Most of the temples and priests are
        those of Boodh or Budda, but there is no such organized priesthood as
        in Burmah, nor is this religion maintained by governmental power. It
        is also considerably modified by the more ancient system of
        polytheism.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Thibet and
        Tartary, the religion of the Grand Lama chiefly prevails, which is
        one form of Boodhism.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In western India,
        Brahmanism is in constant warfare with Boodhism, and the two systems
        are perfectly antagonistic. Brahmanism teaches one eternal deity and
        three hundred and thirty-three millions of other gods, with hosts of
        idols representing them; Boodhism has no deity at all, and only one
        image, that of Gaudama. Brahmanism enjoins sacrifices; Boodhism
        forbids killing. Brahmanism requires atrocious tortures; Boodhism
        inculcates fewer austerities than even Popery. Brahmanism makes
        lying, fornication and theft sometimes commendable, and describes the
        gods as excelling in such crimes; Boodhism never confounds
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span><a name="Pg200"
        id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> right and wrong, and never
        excuses any sin. Brahmanism makes the highest good or chief end of
        man to be absorption into the supreme deity; Boodhism makes
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">annihilation</span></em> the highest hope and
        aim of existence. These two systems, together with Mohammedanism, so
        prevail in Hindostan that the distinct results of each can never be
        compared. These are the prevailing religions in the most advanced
        pagan nations at the present time; and of the two, Boodhism is the
        best, and probably has been the most fairly tested in Burmah.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In past ages the
        two most highly developed heathen nations were those of Greece and
        Rome, and of their religion we have the fullest records. It is not
        probable that any one will consider their system of religion superior
        to this now exhibited of modern paganism.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The result is that
        the most highly developed heathen nations, as yet, have attained but
        very imperfectly the system of common sense.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No heathen
        religion ever taught an eternally-existing Creator, perfect in
        knowledge, wisdom, power and benevolence. None ever taught that the
        chief end of our Creator is happiness-making on the greatest possible
        scale. None ever taught that this also is the chief end for which man
        is created. None ever taught that right moral action, or true virtue,
        consists in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">good willing toward the Creator, toward self,
        and toward our fellow-beings, according to the laws of the Creator,
        so that every mind shall make the good of self subordinate to the
        general good</span></em>. None ever taught that all questions of
        right and wrong, or what is for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">the best</span></em>, are to be decided with
        reference to the risks and dangers of a future life. None ever
        presented communion with, and the care, sympathy, sacrifices, and
        example of a <span class="tei tei-q">“long-suffering”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a name="Pg201"
        id="Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Creator, as motives to secure
        virtuous self-sacrifice from his creatures. If all this is taught by
        revelations from God in the Bible, it is what was never taught by any
        other religion yet known on earth.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the history of
        the heathen world, we find anxious inquiries on these subjects
        pressing on every thoughtful spirit. Who made this world with its
        profound and ceaseless sorrows? Are there contending deities, and are
        the malignant powers in the ascendant? If there be one supreme
        Creator of all, is he propitious or hostile to a race so guilty as
        ours? Does he feel any pity or sympathy for our profound ignorance,
        our infinite sorrows? Can we do any thing to gain his help in our
        darkness and misery? Where do we go when we die? Does our short and
        painful span of being end in eternal night, or are we to go on in
        another career of similar suffering and change? When we lay our
        beloved ones in the grave, shall we ever meet them again, or is
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the only proper utterance of a broken heart,
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">vale,
        vale, in eternum vale</span></span>?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These have been
        the mournful questionings of every age and every race, while the
        wisest sages of the wisest nations, without a revelation, have been
        unable to give any satisfactory reply.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Greece and Rome
        were the most civilized of all ancient nations, and they give us
        Socrates, Plato, Aristotle and Cicero, as their best and wisest men,
        who most deeply pondered these great questions. Aristotle held to one
        superior deity, but taught that the stars are true and eternal
        deities. Cicero leads to the belief of many gods, and approves of
        worshiping distinguished men as gods. Socrates held to a plurality
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202"
        id="Pg202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of deities, and also to
        transmigration. He held that the common sort of good men will go into
        the forms of bees, ants, and other animals of a mild and social kind.
        Plato held to two principles, God and matter, and that God was not
        concerned either in the creation or government of this world. He
        argued for the immortality of the soul on the ground of its
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">pre-existence</span></em>, and concludes some of
        his speculations thus:</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“We can not of ourselves know what will be pleasing to
        God, or what worship to pay him; but it is needful that a lawgiver be

        desire to see him, and who he is!”</span></p>

        portion of this work the Augustinian theory, with the system based on
        it, has been presented as it is taught by creeds and theologians. In

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The evidence will
        now be presented, to show that those who teach the Augustinian
        system, at the same time teach the main points of the common-sense
        system; and where the two systems are contradictory, that they teach
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A leading feature

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this case, the
        language of Dr. Dwight is not so discriminating and clear as that of
        President Edwards—for he does not show so clearly as does President
        Edwards that his real meaning is voluntary happiness-making
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">on the
        largest scale</span></em>. In this, and all the following quotations
        from other writers, it is a fact, as gained by their <em class=

        expressions, that the distinction <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        "tei tei-anchor"></a> made by President Edwards was accepted, and
        that by the <span class="tei tei-q">“love of doing good,”</span> or

        intended that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">best
        good</span></em> of all.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dr. Taylor, the
        distinguished successor of Dr. Dwight, teaches the same doctrine, as
        is so abundantly manifest in his published writings, that no
        quotations will be deemed needful.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Westminster
        Assembly's Catechism teaches that</p>

        <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=
        "margin-right: 3.60em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em">

        for ever.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span></p>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The glory of God
        can be secured only by true virtue in himself and in his creatures;
        and if this consists in voluntary happiness-making on the greatest
        possible scale, then the chief end of man, as taught in that old
        standard of orthodoxy, is exactly the same as is taught in the system
        of common sense. Man is to make happiness on the greatest possible
        scale, guided by the laws of God—and thus doing, he will <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“glorify God and enjoy him for ever.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same
        theologians also teach that the laws of God are our guide as to what
        is good and evil, and that true virtue, or right action, is secured
        only by obeying these laws. They hold, therefore, the doctrine of
        common sense, that all true virtue consists in voluntary obedience to
        the will of God as manifested in his natural and revealed laws.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next point of
        agreement is in the proposition, that God always has, and always will
        do what is <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for the
        best</span></em>”</span>—so that it always is and will be, out of his
        power <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page207">[pg 207]</span><a name=
        "Pg207" id="Pg207" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to do better—inasmuch
        as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to do
        better than best</span></em>, is a contradiction and absurdity. Every
        theologian, in one form of words or another, maintains that God
        always has done, and always will do, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the best he
        can</span></em>, so that he has no power to do better. This being so,
        it is the same as teaching that the past, present and future
        existence of sin and misery, is what is inevitable in the best system
        which God has power to create, so that any change in God's plans,
        laws, and their results, would imply an act of folly and malevolence
        on his part.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This does not
        imply that the sinful conduct of man is what is desired or intended
        by the Creator—nor does it imply that sin was desired or intended by
        God as the <span class="tei tei-q">“necessary means to the greatest
        good.”</span> Instead of this, it is clear that if it had been
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">possible</span></em>—<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, if
        God had the power—to create all minds with <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all the knowledge and
        all the motives</span></em> that would secure perfect obedience to
        law from all the race of Adam, there would have been more happiness.
        The universal obedience of all free agents to all God's laws for
        making happiness on the greatest possible scale, would secure perfect
        happiness to all, while every act of disobedience would lessen the
        amount. To deny this is the same as saying that less happiness is
        more than the most happiness, which is absurd.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The result is,
        that sin is not the fault of the Creator, but is the inevitable
        result of the commencement of finite, ignorant, inexperienced minds,
        and is what neither God nor man could prevent, in a perfect system of
        finite, free agents.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the same time,
        it is the fault of all free agents who sin when they have adequate
        knowledge and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg
        208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        motives. And it is only sins against <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">known</span></em> law
        and appropriate motives which are the proper subject of penalties
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in
        addition</span></em> to the natural consequences of wrong doing.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is claimed,
        therefore, that when theologians teach—as all do—that <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“God orders all things for the best,”</span> they really
        teach, in another form, the common-sense doctrine as stated
        above.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having gained the
        teachings of leading theologians as to the nature of true virtue or
        right voluntary action, we also gain their definition of wrong moral
        action, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sin</span></em>. In the words of President
        Edwards, <span class="tei tei-q">“Every <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">voluntary</span></em>
        action which in its general tendency and ultimate consequence leads
        to happiness—happiness <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">in general</span></em>—happiness <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">on the largest
        scale</span></em>—is virtuous; and every such action which <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">has not
        this</span></em> tendency, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">does not</span></em> lead to this consequence,
        is vicious,”</span> or sinful.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That is to say,
        every volition that tends to lessen the general happiness, is vicious
        or sinful, and every violation of God's physical, social and moral
        laws, has this tendency. Thus the Bible definition of <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sin</span></em> is
        the one accepted by theologians—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sin is the transgression of
        law</span></em>,”</span> without reference to the question whether
        the law is known or not. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">True virtue</span></em> is voluntary obedience
        to law, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sin</span></em> is the voluntary transgression
        of law. These definitions then are a part of the Augustinian system
        as much as they are of the common-sense system.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next point of
        the common-sense system taught by theologians, is that our moral
        power to obey God—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, power to choose according to
        law instead of impulse—is proportioned to our knowledge of law,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span><a name="Pg209"
        id="Pg209" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and the motives of fear, hope,
        love and gratitude, as they are employed by God and man.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This doctrine is
        taught by all theologians, except those who hold that the sin of Adam
        so ruined the human mind, that there is no power of <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">any</span></em> kind
        to obey God, except as he gives new capacities. No quotations will be
        given to establish this point, because, it is believed, that no one
        will question it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No quotations are
        needed to show that the Augustinian creeds and theologians agree with
        the common-sense system, in teaching that the soul is immortal—that
        our destiny in a future state depends on our conduct in this
        life—that there is to be an eternal separation of the righteous and
        the wicked, whose immortality will be happy or miserable according to
        their characters.</p>

        chapter shows the agreement of distinguished Augustinian theologians
        with the leading points of the common-sense system. We next are to

        creeds contradict the common-sense system, and thus, also, contradict
        themselves.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The grand point,
        which involves these contradictions, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page210">[pg 210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> is the dogma that all mankind have a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">depraved
        nature</span></em> consequent on the sin of Adam, which makes it
        certain that every voluntary act of every human mind is <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“sin, and only sin,”</span> until this depravity of
        nature is more or less rectified by the Spirit of God. The opposite
        of this is the common-sense doctrine that all men have a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perfect
        nature</span></em>, created by God, which is unchanged and not in any
        way depraved by the sin of Adam.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As involved in
        this common-sense view, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">true virtue</span></em> consists in the

        "font-style: italic">after</span></em> it has been more or less
        renewed by the Spirit of God.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Common sense
        claims that the indispensable requisites to secure right voluntary
        action are, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        on God, on man, and on self, conjointly. In opposition,
        Augustinianism claims that knowledge, training and motives are of no
        avail to secure true virtue, until the damage done by Adam's sin to
        the nature of every human mind, is more or less rectified, and that
        for this we are entirely dependent on the Spirit of God.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Common sense
        claims that man, at birth and through life, is entirely unable to
        obey many of the physical, social and moral laws of God, for want of
        adequate knowledge, training and motives; but that he is fully able
        to obey these laws as fast as he has the appropriate knowledge,
        training and motives, and that before regeneration he does perform
        truly virtuous acts. Augustinianism, in opposition, claims that man
        never obeys the laws of God acceptably until the Spirit of

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Common sense
        teaches that the commencement of <span class="tei tei-q">“a new

        the commencement of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        of God, which purpose may be an unconscious, gradual process by
        educational training, or it may be an instantaneous and conscious
        act. Augustinianism teaches that <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“regeneration”</span> or the <span class="tei tei-q">“new
        birth”</span> consists in the re-creation or change of the nature of
        mind, so as, more or less, to remedy the depravity consequent on
        Adam's sin.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Common sense
        teaches that every volition of every mind, which in act and intention
        is conformed to the laws of rectitude, is truly virtuous in every
        proper use of the term, without any reference to the question either
        of a ruling purpose or a change of nature. Augustinianism teaches
        that every volition of every mind is sin, and only sin, previous to
        the act of regeneration accomplished by the Spirit of God.<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To illustrate the
        above by examples, suppose that a child is trained to deny itself, to
        relieve suffering, or to make others happy. In its earlier efforts
        this is very <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg
        212]</span><a name="Pg212" id="Pg212" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        difficult, though by practice the principle of habit renders it more
        and more easy. Common sense teaches that the first act of self-denial
        for the best good of others, in which the aim or intention is to do
        right, is truly virtuous. For the thing done is right, and the motive
        or intention is right. But Augustinianism says no; such an act is
        <span class="tei tei-q">“sin, and only sin,”</span> previous to
        regeneration, though it is true virtue after regeneration.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, a young man
        is trained to abhor meanness and deceit and to suffer any thing
        rather than to violate his plighted faith. He is brought into an
        extremity where, by a false statement, he can escape poverty and
        disgrace to himself and his family. He sacrifices all rather than to
        violate his word and honor.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If he is not a
        regenerate man, Augustinianism says this act is not truly virtuous,
        but is <span class="tei tei-q">“sin, and only sin.”</span> Common
        sense says, it is a virtuous act in every sense of the term as used
        among men.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have shown by
        quotations that Augustinian theologians teach that man's nature is
        the only guide to the nature of God, and, as his work and image, is
        perfect in construction. At the same time they teach that man's
        nature is so totally depraved that it never acts morally right, in a
        single instance, until it is regenerated by God, and that all sin is
        the natural result of this depravity of nature.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In consequence of
        this contradictory starting-point, they proceed to other
        contradictory instruction. For example, in the education of very
        young children most theologians, of whatever school, teach them that
        to speak the truth, to obey parents, to deny one's self <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page213">[pg 213]</span><a name="Pg213" id="Pg213"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> for the good of others, is right, good
        and virtuous. They teach that when little children act thus, before
        regeneration, they not only act virtuously, but that God approves and
        loves them for it. In doing this, they use the words <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good</span></em>,
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">right</span></em> and <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">virtuous</span></em>,
        in the ordinary sense in which men understand these terms.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But at the same
        time, the same theologians are teaching from the pulpit and the
        press, that every voluntary act of every child is <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“sin, and only sin,”</span> previous to regeneration;
        that there is no good, right and virtuous act in an unregenerated
        mind, and that God feels no approbation or complacency in such acts
        or the unregenerated as the above, which are called virtuous, but are
        really sin.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is manifest
        that the educational training of the young must be radically diverse
        just in proportion as one or the other of these two systems
        prevails.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the Augustinian
        theory, there is no hope of any right moral action, or truly virtuous
        conduct, until the depraved nature transmitted from Adam is
        regenerated. On the common-sense theory, every attempt of a parent or
        educator, and every effort of a child to secure what is best and
        right with the intention thus to secure it, is truly virtuous, and
        every repetition is valuable as tending to secure virtuous habits and
        character.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the Augustinian
        theory, religious instruction is only an appointed mode by which God
        chooses to regenerate a depraved nature. It is a process for securing
        a new nature from God. On the common-sense theory, religious training
        is a process for securing the development and right action of mind by
        the influences <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg
        214]</span><a name="Pg214" id="Pg214" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of
        knowledge, training and motives, and without any change of its
        nature.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is also clear
        that these two systems must be very diverse in reference to the
        interpretations of the Creator's will as gained by reason or by
        revelations from God.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the Augustinian
        theory, mind is so totally depraved as to be incapable of
        interpreting correctly, either the natural teachings of reason and
        experience, or the recorded revelations from God. Owing to this,
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">authorized
        interpreters</span></em> of God's will are indispensable. This makes
        the whole human race dependent on a class of men authorized by God to
        interpret his natural laws and revealed will.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the contrary,
        the common-sense theory claims that every mind, in proportion as its
        powers are cultivated and developed, has the means of discovering the
        end for which all things are created, and of interpreting the
        teachings of reason and experience, and also of interpreting any
        revealed records of God's will.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It thus appears
        that theologians and creeds that adopt the Augustinian theory
        contradict themselves mainly in these two points:</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">First, they teach
        that man's nature <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">is</span></em> depraved and that it is
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">not</span></em> depraved.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next, that
        previous to regeneration, men do not perform any truly virtuous acts,
        and yet that while unregenerated they do perform such acts.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The quotation from
        creeds and theologians, in preceding chapters, is proof that they
        teach that man's nature is thus depraved, and that previous to
        regeneration he never performs a single truly virtuous act.
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page215">[pg 215]</span><a name="Pg215"
        id="Pg215" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> This and the preceding chapter
        present some of the evidence that they teach the opposite.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The following is
        submitted as still further evidence of such contradictions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the first
        place, it is allowed by all, that the Augustinian creeds and
        theologians teach that man, as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">a race</span></em>, including every individual,
        has a depraved <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">nature</span></em>. The question, then, all
        turns on the meaning of the word <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em>,
        and whether they affirm its depravity <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the same
        sense</span></em> as they affirm that in nature man is the living
        image of the living God and our only guide to a knowledge of him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is claimed that
        they do use the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">nature</span></em> in one and the same sense
        when they affirm that man's nature <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em> and
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is
        not</span></em> depraved. In proof of this we must resort to our
        lexicographers who have collected the various senses in which mankind
        use the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">nature</span></em>. And here we must again
        recognize the fact that the true meaning of every word is settled
        simply by ascertaining <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">what meaning men attach to it when they use
        it</span></em>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In examining our
        dictionaries, we shall find that the word <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em> is
        used sometimes to signify every thing that God has created; as when
        it is said, <span class="tei tei-q">“all nature speaks its Maker's
        praise.”</span> Sometimes, by a figurative use, the Author of all
        things is called Nature, as when it is said that <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nature paints the flowers and spreads her
        repasts.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No one will claim
        that either of these is the sense in which the word is used in
        reference to the nature of the mind of man as a race.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The leading and
        primary signification of the word <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em> is
        that which is intended and understood when <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page216">[pg 216]</span><a name="Pg216" id="Pg216" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> we say that <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">nature</span></em> of a design or construction
        is proof of the character and intention of the author.”</span> It is
        in this sense that men use the word when they speak of the nature of
        animals, the nature of trees, and the nature of the soul.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this use, it
        has but one signification, and that is, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">those qualities,
        powers and faculties which are discovered by experience and
        observation</span></em>. Or in other words, when we discover the
        qualities of a thing, how it acts, and how it is acted upon, we learn
        its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">nature</span></em>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In regard to all
        other existences except mind, the only mode of discovering <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">their
        nature</span></em> is to ascertain by experience and observation how
        they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">invariably</span></em> appear and act. Thus we
        decide that it is the nature of water to run down hill by finding
        that it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">invariably</span></em> does so; and that it is
        the nature of smoke to rise in the atmosphere by observing that it
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">invariably</span></em> ascends.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Owing to this,
        mankind often use the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">nature</span></em> as signifying <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that which is
        according to ordinary experience</span></em>. That is to say, the
        same word is used to express the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">qualities and
        powers</span></em> of things, and also to express that <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">invariable
        experience</span></em> by which we learn these qualities and powers.
        What is according to our ordinary experience we say is according to
        nature, and what is contrary to ordinary experience is contrary to
        nature.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus it is
        according to nature for water to run down hill, and it is contrary to
        nature for it to run up hill.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is mind, in
        distinction from matter, which has the power of <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">willing</span></em>,
        and this is a power which never is exercised <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">invariably</span></em> one way or another.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But theologians
        have practiced this fallacy on themselves <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page217">[pg 217]</span><a name="Pg217" id="Pg217" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> and others. They first assume, what is contrary
        to fact, that mind <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">invariably</span></em> chooses one way, and that
        is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">wrong</span></em>, from birth to regeneration.
        This being assumed without proof, they claim that the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em> of
        the human mind is thus proved to be depraved, and totally so.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having thus, as
        they imagine, established its depraved voluntary nature, they claim
        that, like all other things, the mind <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">must act according to
        its nature</span></em>, which, being wholly depraved, all its moral
        acts are consequently depraved.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is what
        logicians call <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">arguing in a circle</span></em>; <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
        they prove that it acts <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">invariably</span></em> wrong because it is
        totally depraved, and it is totally depraved because it acts
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">invariably</span></em> wrong.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But common sense
        denies the starting assumption; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">invariably</span></em> wrong volitions of every
        mind from birth to regeneration. On the contrary, it is claimed that
        every choice which secures enjoyment without violating law, is right,
        and that whenever a mind chooses what is right, with the intention to
        act right, the choice is a truly virtuous act, and that all men make
        such choices very often before regeneration.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whatever is
        according to ordinary experience in the qualities and action of mind,
        is said to be according to its nature. It is according to the nature
        of mind, then, sometimes to choose what is good, right and virtuous,
        and at other times to choose what is evil and wrong, according to its
        knowledge, temptations and habits. Such a case never was known as a
        mind that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">invariably</span></em> chose wrong.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In view of the
        preceding, it is maintained that the word <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em>,
        as applied to mind, as settled by lexicographers, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg 218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> is always used to signify the same as its
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">constitutional powers and faculties</span></em>,
        and that this is the sense in which it is employed when we say
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">nature</span></em> of a construction or design
        is proof of the character and intention of the author.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We are now
        prepared to show that theologians use the word nature in this same
        sense when they affirm that it is totally depraved, and when, at the
        same time, they teach that it is the image of God, and our only guide
        to his nature and character.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We shall first
        present the evidence that they use the word in this sense, when they
        teach that every human mind is so depraved in nature that from birth
        to regeneration every moral act is sin, and only sin.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first item of
        evidence is the fact that all the other meanings of the word, in our
        dictionaries, except this, can be shown to be <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> the
        ones in which theologians use the word in reference to men as a race,
        so that this use is the only one remaining. They must use it in this
        sense, as the only one left, all others being necessarily
        excluded.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, the mode by
        which they attempt to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">prove</span></em> that man has a depraved
        nature, shows that they use the word in this sense. For they exhibit
        the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wrong
        action</span></em>, or sinful feelings and conduct of the race, as
        the chief proof. Their argument is this: the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em> of
        a thing is proved by its qualities, how it acts, and how it is acted
        upon. The human mind <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">invariably</span></em> acts depraved, therefore
        its nature is depraved. No one will deny that theologians always
        present the wicked feelings and conduct of children and of men as the
        proofs of a depraved nature.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is true, that
        in doing this they misstate facts, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page219">[pg 219]</span><a name="Pg219" id="Pg219" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> maintain that <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> the
        actions of men are sin, and only sin. This contradicts experience and
        common sense, which affirm that the human mind sometimes acts right
        and sometimes wrong, from the first; showing that the nature of mind
        is such that it naturally acts right as well as wrong. But this
        attempt proves that they used the word in the sense here stated.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again: that
        theologians use the word in this sense, is manifest from their
        attempts to relieve the character of God from the charge of being
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the author of sin.”</span> They can not deny
        that the nature of a contrivance proves the character and intention
        of the author, and that, if God is the author of man's depravity by a
        wrong <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">construction</span></em> or <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em> of
        mind, it would be proof that he is the author of all the sin
        resulting from it, and thus a depraved character.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Instead of denying
        this use of the term, they allow it, and then try to make man himself
        the author of this depraved nature, either <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by</span></em>, or
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">in</span></em>, or <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">before</span></em>
        Adam. That is, they allow that man's mind <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em> wrong
        in construction, but claim that he himself is the author of this
        wrong.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again: that
        theologians use the word nature in this sense, is proved by their
        description of the depravity intended by them. When they are urged to
        point out what the depraved nature of man consists in, they always
        state something which shows it to be wrong in <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">construction</span></em>, and which is exhibited
        in the wrong <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">action</span></em> of mind.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are these
        following methods of describing this depravity, viz.:</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1. It is called a
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">bias</span></em>, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">propensity</span></em>, or <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">inclination</span></em> to sin.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. It is called an
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">unbalanced</span></em> state of the
        faculties.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg
        220]</span><a name="Pg220" id="Pg220" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. It is called a
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">habit</span></em> of sinning formed in a
        pre-existent state.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">4. It is called a
        wrong <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">combination</span></em>, or <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">proportion</span></em>, in the mental
        faculties.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">5. It is called a
        state resulting from the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">deprivation</span></em> of God's Spirit.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will now be
        shown that each and all of these equally involve the idea of that
        malformation or wrong construction which proves its author
        depraved.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first is the
        most common method. On this view, it is claimed that the minds of
        angels and of Adam were constructed with such a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bias</span></em> or
        tendency to good as secured their perfect action for a given period.
        The mind of man, on the contrary, begins existence here so
        constructed that it has a contrary <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bias</span></em> to
        evil; so that it never, in a single instance, chooses right till
        regenerated.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The angels and
        Adam had a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">holy nature</span></em>, meaning a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bias</span></em>,
        which God created. Mankind have a contrary bias, which is a
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">depraved
        nature</span></em>, and of this, man is the author, either <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in</span></em>, or
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">by</span></em>, or <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">before</span></em>
        Adam. And they all allow, that if God had created this depraved bias,
        or depraved nature, he would be <span class="tei tei-q">“the author
        of sin.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second mode
        is, the claim that man's depravity consists in an <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unbalanced
        state</span></em> of his faculties or propensities. The angels and
        Adam were created by God with the proper balance, and this is the
        holy nature made by God. Man is born with an unbalanced state of the
        faculties, and this was created by man himself, either <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by</span></em>, or
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">in</span></em>, or <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">before</span></em>
        Adam. Now the balance of the faculties is as much a part of the
        construction of mind as any thing else, and if God created this
        depraved, he is proved to be depraved.</p><span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page221">[pg 221]</span><a name="Pg221" id="Pg221" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The third mode is,
        the claim that the depravity of man's mind consists in a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">habit of
        sinning</span></em>. On this view, God created man's mind aright, in
        all respects, in a preëxistent state. In this normal condition of
        mind, every propensity was toward not only <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good</span></em>, but
        to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">best</span></em> good, while there was
        sufficient <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">knowledge</span></em> of right created also, to
        save from all mistakes of judgment as to what is best and right. In
        this perfect state <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">some</span></em> minds began to sin, and thus
        formed a habit of sinning, and were then sent into this world to be
        reformed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here it is plain,
        that the depravity intended is depravity of construction. For
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">habit</span></em>, as men use the term,
        expresses the fact that repetition in the use of any faculty
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">increases
        its power</span></em>. It is a change in the constitutional
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">construction</span></em> of mind induced by use.
        For example, a child has little constitutional power of mind to
        reason or to calculate figures. By use, this deficiency of
        construction is modified.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Habit</span></em>,
        then, modifies the constitutional organization of mind.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This mode of
        describing the depravity of mind teaches the misconstruction of
        constitutional organization as much as all the others, but it
        furnishes another mode by which it was induced, so as to make man the
        author in a way that is comprehensible, and not absurd.<a id=
        "noteref_16" name="noteref_16" href="#note_16"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fourth mode is
        the claim that the depravity of the human mind consists in the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">disparities, or varieties, of constitutional
        organization</span></em>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been shown
        that such disparities, as parts of a vast system in which the best
        good of the whole is the best good of each part, are indispensable to
        the perfect construction of mind in relation to that
        system.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page222">[pg
        222]</span><a name="Pg222" id="Pg222" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the depravity
        claimed is, that which is common to <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every</span></em>
        mind, and is so total that not a single mind, however highly endowed,
        ever, even in one case, acts virtuously till regenerated. Thus the
        best in mental construction are as totally depraved as the worst. At
        the same time, it is clear that it is constitutional malformation
        that is taught, and nothing else.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fifth mode of
        describing the depravity of mind is that it consists in the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">deprivation</span></em> of God's Spirit.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The result of this
        deprivation is thus described by Dr. Hodge, of the Princeton
        Calvinist school of divines:</p>

        <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=
        "margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em">
        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style=
        "font-size: 90%">In consequence of this withdrawal we begin to exist
        in moral darkness,</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">destitute of a
        disposition</span></em> <span style="font-size: 90%">to delight in
        God.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span></p>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Arminius, the
        chief theologian of the Methodists, describes it thus:</p>

        <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=
        "margin-left: 3.60em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style=
        "font-size: 90%">The will of man, with respect to the</span>
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">true
          good</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, is not only wounded,
          bruised, inferior, crooked and attenuated, but is likewise
          captivated, destroyed and lost; and has</span> <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">no
          powers whatever</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, except
          such as are excited by grace.</span><span style=
          "font-size: 90%">”</span></span></p>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the presence
        of God's Spirit in Adam's mind, according to Dr. Hodge, insured a
        <span class="tei tei-q">“disposition”</span> to delight in God, which
        was lost by its withdrawal. According to Arminius, this withdrawal so
        affected the whole race, that <span class="tei tei-q">“in respect to
        the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">true
        good</span></em>”</span> the will of man has <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no powers
        whatever</span></em>, except such as are excited by grace—that is, by
        a measured return of God's Spirit, withdrawn for Adam's sin, which
        return was purchased by Christ's death.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is clear, that
        it is the powers and faculties of mind that are meant here, in this
        explanation of the depravity of man's nature.</p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page223">[pg 223]</span><a name="Pg223" id="Pg223"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus it is shown
        that every attempt to explain what depravity consists in, by
        theologians, results in their teaching a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">constitutional
        malformation</span></em>, which proves the author of the construction
        to be depraved.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We will now
        present the evidence, that theologians contradict themselves, and
        deny that they use the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">nature</span></em> in the sense of
        constitutional organization or construction, and maintain that they
        use it in some other sense.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In all creeds and
        all theological teachings, the authors expressly disclaim that they
        maintain any thing which makes God <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        author of sin.”</span> And they allow, that making God the creator of
        a depraved nature, would make him the author of sin. Therefore, to
        escape the difficulty, they claim that God is the author of one
        nature, which is perfect and in his own image, and that there is
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">another</span></em> nature which man himself
        made, either <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">by</span></em>, or <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in</span></em>, or
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">before</span></em> Adam, which is depraved. Then
        when they are driven to identify the nature that God made and the
        nature that man made, they are again at fault. Man really has but one
        nature, and that is the nature which is discovered by his qualities
        and actions, as learned by experience. There is no other nature
        conceivable, and no other idea that men ever attach to the word when
        applied to the mind or soul of man. Therefore, theologians really do
        use it in the sense which they deny, for there is no other.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, theologians
        deny that they teach <span class="tei tei-q">“physical
        depravity”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“physical
        regeneration,”</span> and the only intelligible sense of this
        disclaimer is, that they do not teach depravity of construction and
        the reformation of this depravity of construction. But, as before
        shown, when they describe the depravity and regeneration,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page224">[pg 224]</span><a name="Pg224"
        id="Pg224" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> they make out what actually is
        physical depravity and physical regeneration, and nothing else.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, when they
        attempt to describe what they mean, one class of
        theologians—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, new school Calvinists—teach
        that the whole depravity consists in a want of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">right willing</span></em>.”</span> And this is
        exactly what the common-sense system teaches—<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
        that the depravity of man is in the wrong <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">action</span></em>
        and not in the wrong <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">construction</span></em> of mind. And yet when
        they are charged with holding the Pelagian doctrine of perfect mental
        construction, they deny it, and say they teach depravity of
        nature.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As an example of
        this, is presented the following extract from the writings of Dr.
        Bennet Tyler, the president of a theological seminary established to

        opposition to the supposed Pelagian innovations of the New Haven

        remarkable illustration of self-contradiction among theologians,
        involved in every attempt to maintain a depraved nature consequent on
        Adam's sin, is found in the teachings of Dr. Taylor, the leader of
        the New Haven school of divines.</p>

        charges against himself, of teaching the Pelagian tenet, that man's
        depravity consists, not in nature, but in action. In reference to
        this he writes thus:</p>

        certainly, what this difference is between the nature of Adam and
        that of his descendants; but he maintains that while Adam's nature

        possible to make these two extracts any thing other than exact

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Adam is a type
          of Christ, and as by Adam's sin natural death came on all who are
          his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">natural children</span></em>, (for they all,
          like Adam, have <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sinned</span></em> and suffer death as the
          consequence,) so by one man, Christ, spiritual life comes to all
          who are Christ's <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">spiritual children</span></em>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This simply
          teaches that Adam as the head of a sinning race, who suffer death
          in consequence of his sin and their own, is an emblem or type of
          Christ, the head of a holy family, who by him receive spiritual
          life. Condemnation and natural death come from sinning, both to
          Adam and to all the children brought into being by him.
          Justification and spiritual life come from Christ to all whom he
          has caused to become his spiritual children.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For abundant
          proof that this was the interpretation of this passage, from the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been
          shown that the Princeton theologians teach, that though all men did
          not sin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">in</span></em> Adam, or sin at all, before
          they were born, yet God <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          them <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as
          if</span></em> they had committed it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Their
          interpretation of this passage then is briefly this:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As by, or on
          account of, Adam's sin a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">condemning sentence</span></em> came on all
          men, so by Christ's obedience a <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sentence of
          acquittal</span></em> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, justification) came on all
          who are regenerated.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to
          these divines, verse 12 does not refer to a depraved <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em>
          nor to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">actual sin</span></em>, but only to the fact
          that all suffer the penalty for Adam's sin through all time and
          eternity, unless they are regenerated. The Princeton school of
          divines are the most strongly Calvinistic in maintaining the total
          depravity of man and his entire inability to perform any truly
          virtuous act previous to regeneration.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here, then, we
          have these results:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Augustinian
          theory of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">the depraved nature</span></em> of man,
          consequent on Adam's sin, contradicts the common sense and moral
          sense of mankind, contradicts the creeds and teachings that contain
          it, and is not taught in the chief passage in the Bible claimed as
          teaching it, as interpreted by the whole Christian world in the
          first four centuries, and by a large body of Calvinistic divines
          who teach total depravity at the present time.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whoever, then,
          denies that this passage of the Bible <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page232">[pg 232]</span><a name="Pg232" id="Pg232" class=

          whole Church of the Apostolic ages and by a great body of the
          highest Calvinistic churches at this day.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are some
          other passages that may be referred to as relating to this subject.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The

          obedience which the natural penalties of law could not secure, but

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One other text

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this passage
          the <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          <span class="tei tei-q">“man as he is found in our ordinary

          as a race, do not understand or obey the truth as it is taught by
          Christ and the Spirit of God. The fact is <span class="tei tei-pb"

        From The Creator Impossible If It Contains The Augustinian
        Theory.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The object aimed
        at in this chapter demands attention to the following
        preliminaries.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before we can gain
        a reliable revelation from our Creator, we are obliged to establish
        the truth that there is such a Creator. Our only mode of doing this
        is by the method already set forth in chapter 10, and for which we
        are dependent on our reason or common sense.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having, by the aid
        of reason, arrived at a knowledge of the existence and character of
        the Creator, we next inquire as to the mode by which we can receive
        direct revelations from him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here we find that
        we are again wholly dependent on reason or common sense. The
        principle on which we alone rely for revelations from God is
        this:</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg
        235]</span><a name="Pg235" id="Pg235" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A change in the
        established order of nature surpassing human power, is evidence of a
        supernatural agency that is sanctioned by the Author of the Laws of
        Nature.</span></span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The conviction of
        the wisdom and power of the Author of this vast and wonderful frame
        around us is such that, whatever changes may occur in its established
        order, must be felt to be by his permission.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To illustrate
        this, suppose a man appeared, claiming to be a teacher sent from God.
        In proof of this, he commands a mountain to be uptorn and thrown into
        the sea. Now, if this phenomenon should follow his command, it would
        be impossible for any who witnessed it, to refrain from believing
        that the Author of Nature performed this miracle to attest the
        authority of his messenger.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In order to insure
        this belief in the interference of the Creator, there must be full
        evidence that there can be no deception, and that the miraculous
        performance is entirely beyond human power and skill. Men always talk
        and act on the assumption that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">such</span></em> miracles are from God, and all
        rational minds so regard them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have shown that
        the chief cause of a wrong action of mind, is that it commences
        existence in perfect ignorance, while all those causes which
        experience shows to be indispensable to its right action, to a
        greater or less degree are wanting.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The grand want of
        our race is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        minds, who are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">infallible teachers of what is right and
        true</span></em>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have presented
        the evidence gained by reason and experience that the Creator is
        perfect in mental <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg

        that is possible</span></em> for the highest good of his creatures in
        this world, and that he always will continue to do so.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We proceed to
        inquire in regard to what would be the best that is possible to be
        done for us in this state of being, <em class=

        great cause of the wrong action of mind is the ignorance and
        imperfection of those who are its educators in the beginning of its
        existence, we should infer that the best possible thing to be done
        for our race, would be to provide some <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perfect and
        infallible teacher</span></em> to instruct those who are to educate
        mind. This being granted, then all would concede that the Creator
        himself would be our best teacher, and that, if he would come to us
        himself in a visible form, to instruct the educators of mind in all
        they need to know, for themselves and for the new-born minds
        committed to their care, it would be the best thing we can conceive
        of for the highest good of our race.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We next inquire as
        to the best conceivable mode by which the Creator can manifest
        himself so as to secure credence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To decide this,
        let each one suppose the case his own. Let a man make his appearance
        claiming to be the Creator. We can perceive that his mere word would
        never command the confidence of intelligent practical men. Thousands
        of impostors have appeared and made such claims, deceiving the weak
        and ignorant and disgusting the wise.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A person with such
        claims, were he ever so benevolent and intelligent, but having had no
        other evidence <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg
        237]</span><a name="Pg237" id="Pg237" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        than his word to support them, would, by sensible persons, be
        regarded as the victim of some mental hallucination.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But suppose that a
        person claiming to be the Creator of all things, or to be a messenger
        from him, should attest his claim by shaking the earth, or turning
        back the floods of the ocean, it would be impossible for any man to
        witness these miracles without believing, that the Author of all
        things thus attested his own presence or the authority of his
        messenger. We have shown that the very organization of mind would
        necessarily force such a belief on all sane minds.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One other method
        would be as effective. Should this person predict events so
        improbable and so beyond all human intelligence, as to be equivalent
        to an equal interruption of experience as to the laws of mind, as
        time developed the fulfillment of these predictions, the same belief
        would be induced in the authority of the person thus supernaturally
        endowed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the case of
        miracles, the evidence would be immediate and most powerful in its
        inception. In the case of prophecy, the power of the evidence would
        increase with time.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Miracles and
        prophecy</span></em>, then, are the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only</span></em>
        methods that we can conceive of, that would, as our minds are now
        constituted, insure belief in revelations from the Creator.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But if every human
        being, in order to believe, must have miracles, there would result
        such an incessant violation of the laws of nature as to destroy them,
        and thus to destroy all possibility of miracles.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The only possible
        way, then, to establish revelations to the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">race</span></em>, is
        to have them occur at certain periods of time, and then have them
        adequately <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">recorded and
        preserved</span></em>.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page238">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Bible is a
        collection of books written at different periods of the world's
        history. These books profess to be records of the various
        manifestations and teachings of the Creator to mankind. It is claimed
        for them, that their authority is established by miracles and
        prophecy, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">with all the evidence that is possible, so far
        as we can conceive</span></em>, and that there are no other books in
        the world having any <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">such</span></em> evidence of authorized
        revelations from God.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No attempt will be
        made to set forth this evidence, which, it is claimed, is peculiar to
        the Bible. The point here attempted is, to show that, were the
        Augustinian system contained in these writings, it would destroy
        their claims as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">reliable</span></em> revelations from God, even
        allowing that miracles and prophecy attested their authority.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All must allow
        that it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">possible</span></em> to have such things given
        in a revelation from God as would destroy its reliability. For
        example, suppose it were a fact that a revelation, supported by
        miracles, taught that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">there was no God</span></em>. This would
        necessarily destroy its authority as a revelation from God.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Suppose again,
        that it taught that the Creator, who wrought the attesting miracles,
        was a liar, and loved to deceive his creatures; this would also
        destroy its reliability as a guide to truth.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Suppose again,
        that it taught that the Creator was a being who preferred evil to
        good, and chose to have his creatures ignorant and miserable, when he
        has power to make them wise and happy. This also would destroy the
        reliability of any revelation from the Creator, even were it
        sustained by undisputed miracles and prophecy.</p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg 239]</span><a name="Pg239" id="Pg239"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This last is
        precisely what the Augustinian system <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">does</span></em>
        teach, and, as its advocates claim, it is a part of a revelation from
        the Creator, supported by miracles and prophecy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In opposition to
        this, it is maintained that this system is not to be found in the
        Bible, and that were it there, all the miracles and prophecy
        conceivable could not prove these writings to be revelations from the
        Creator, which are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">reliable</span></em> as our guide to truth and
        happiness. A Creator who wills ignorance and misery to his creatures,
        when he has power to will knowledge and happiness in their place, is
        not a being to be believed or trusted as our guide to truth and
        happiness.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is in this
        light that the Augustinian theory, as a part of the Bible, brings the
        question fairly before <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        Opposing Systems.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The preceding
        chapters have presented the distinctive features of two systems
        which, in their main points, are shown to be contradictory, while
        both are exhibited as incorporated into the chief creeds and
        theological teachings of the Christian world.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is the object
        of this chapter to point out the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tendencies</span></em>
        of these antagonistic systems.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is maintained,
        that the common-sense system, resting as it does on implanted
        principles common to all minds, is evolved and held very much in
        proportion <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg
        240]</span><a name="Pg240" id="Pg240" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to
        the development of the reasoning powers and the moral sense.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That part of this
        system which relates to man's duties and best interests <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in this
        life</span></em>, without reference to a future state, has been more
        harmoniously evolved by the wise and good of all ages and nations
        than any other. Thus, in the teachings of Confucius, Zoroaster,
        Gaudama, Solon, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Seneca, and the
        Antonines, who are among the chief heathen sages, we can find nearly
        all the moral duties of man, to himself and to his fellow-man, which
        are to be found in the Bible. It is true that there are diversities
        and deficiencies in all; but a large body of pure morality could be
        made up from their united teachings. The account given of the system
        of Boodhism in a previous chapter is one illustration of this
        fact.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But, while it is
        comparatively easy for the good and wise heathen to reason out what
        is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">best</span></em> for man in this life, as taught
        by experience, the grand failure is in <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">motives</span></em>
        which will secure <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">obedience</span></em> to the rules of virtue.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“We see the right and yet the wrong
        pursue,”</span> has been the universal lament of humanity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The character of
        the Creator, as <span class="tei tei-q">“the Lord, the Lord God,
        merciful and gracious, slow unto anger, of great kindness;”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“who doth not <em class=

        afflict or grieve the children of men;”</span> who <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“like as a father pitieth his children;”</span> who is
        <span class="tei tei-q">“a father of the fatherless and a judge of

        just and right;”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“a judge of the

        judge the world with righteousness;”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“a righteous God, who trieth the heart and the

        <span class="tei tei-q">“who knoweth our down-sitting and up-rising,

        <span class="tei tei-q">“word is right;”</span> whose <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“word is truth from the beginning;”</span> who is
        <span class="tei tei-q">“plenteous in mercy and truth;”</span> such a
        character as this, as it is recorded in the Jewish sacred books, was
        never evolved or set forth by the wisest and best sages of all the
        earth, unaided by these writings.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That such a Being
        regards our race with long-suffering compassion, and came himself to
        earth, by his teachings, example and <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">self-sacrificing</span></em> love, to save us
        from sin, this was never even <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">imagined</span></em> by any of the heathen sages
        of earth.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">power of
        motive</span></em>, secured by a belief in the omnipresence, sympathy
        and love of such a God, never was attained by the unaided reasoning
        of any human being.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fact that the
        soul survives the dissolution of the body, and that the good go where
        they are happy, and the wicked where they are punished, has been more
        or less clearly evolved by the heathen world. In some nations, as for
        example the followers of Boodhism, this doctrine is quite definite
        and distinct, but with most heathen nations all their notions on this
        subject are dim, shadowy and unpractical.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is those
        nations alone, who have had access to the Bible, who have ever
        attained the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">powerful motives</span></em> which are found in
        the system of common sense. And yet, as has been shown, these
        influences have been, to a great extent, nullified by a contradictory
        system.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page242">[pg
        242]</span><a name="Pg242" id="Pg242" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is claimed,
        that the system of common sense is the one on which the revelations
        of the Creator, contained in the Bible, are founded. This being so,
        those who are most developed in their reasoning powers, and who also
        yield the most reverence to the Bible, are those who are most
        powerfully protected against the pernicious tendencies of the
        antagonistic system of Augustine.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, a system
        which is antagonistic to reason and common sense, has, by
        ecclesiastical authority and perversion, been fastened most firmly on
        that class of minds who bring all their cultivated powers to its
        defense, while at the same time the very cultivation of these powers,
        and their reverence for the Bible, tend to the destruction of the
        same system. We consequently find the strongest defenders, and the
        strongest antagonists of the Augustinian system, in those sects who
        were educated within its entrenchments.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If common sense
        and the Bible are to conquer this false system, it must be done by
        those whose common sense and reverence for the Bible are most
        effective and most prominent. And yet this class of persons are the
        ones, who would the most vigorously apply their energies in the
        defense of a system in which they have been trained from infancy, and
        which is sustained by all the power of public sentiment, and church
        organization. This being premised, the tendencies of the two
        antagonistic systems will now be set forth.</p>

        Systems As They Respect the Cultivation of the Moral and Intellectual
        Powers.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The system of
        common sense rests on the assumption that there are principles of
        right and wrong founded on the eternal nature of things, existing
        independently of the will of the Creator in his own eternal mind, and
        by which his character and conduct may be judged.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The human mind is
        constructed in accordance with these principles, as the embryo image
        of the Eternal Creator. By the aid of these principles, we discover
        the design and character of God in the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em> of
        his works, and can perceive what is right or wrong in moral action as
        tending to fulfill or oppose this design. Thus we are enabled to
        understand and to adore the rectitude, wisdom and goodness of our
        Creator, as manifested either in his works or in more direct
        revelations from him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to this
        system, all voluntary action is right which produces happiness
        without violating the laws of God. Thus every person who is making
        self or others happy in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">best</span></em> way, guided by the teachings of
        experience or by revelations from God, is fulfilling the great design
        of our Maker, and thus pleasing him by promoting his chief
        desire.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the contrary,
        the Augustinian system assumes that the human mind, being totally
        depraved, is entirely disqualified to judge of the character and ways
        of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page244">[pg 244]</span><a name=
        "Pg244" id="Pg244" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> God. Nay more, it
        assumes that there is no standard of right and wrong by which we can
        judge of the rectitude of the ways of God.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to this
        theory, the fact that God wills a thing is what makes it right; so
        that any thing is right if God does it, and true if he says it,
        however contrary it may be to our moral nature and common sense.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the teachings
        of moral science, founded on this theory, it is maintained that God
        has formed our minds to feel certain emotions of approval or
        disapproval in view of certain relations and actions, which are right
        or wrong only as agreeing or disagreeing with his will. But as the
        mind of man is depraved, this constitution is no certain guide, and
        we are dependent on direct revelations from God to teach us what is
        in agreement with his will. Yet here again we are at fault; for such
        is our depravity that we are disqualified to <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">interpret</span></em>
        these revelations, except as we are regenerated by God.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Accordingly, man
        has no means of judging of the designs or character of his Maker—nor,
        while unregenerate, as most of our race are and have been, has he any
        sure means of discovering the will of God, either by reason or
        revelation, saving as he may find infallible priestly
        interpreters.</p>

          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">happiness-making,
          according to the laws of God</span></em>, is the chief end of man,
          naturally leads to the development of the intellect and reason in
          order to discover these laws, and to the devotion of all our
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page245">[pg 245]</span><a name=
          "Pg245" id="Pg245" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> powers to
          happiness-making, according to these laws. This being so, every
          thing that tends to make enjoyment and diminish evil without
          violating law, is valued as good and right. All noble, generous,
          self-sacrificing and honorable sentiments and acts are regarded as
          right, pleasing to the Father of all, and tending equally to
          promote the best good of ourselves and of all our fellow-beings. In
          this light we become <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          good beings just so far as we obey all the physical, social and
          moral laws of our Creator, and thus conform to his will, and add to
          his happiness. Thus the direct tendency of this system is to
          promote an earnest desire, first to discover all that is true and
          right, and then to follow it. And such efforts naturally tend both
          to develop our highest powers, and to bring the mind into harmony
          and communion with the Father of our spirits.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the contrary,
          the Augustinian system, resting on the assumption that all the
          plans and ways of God are a mystery beyond our comprehension; that
          man, by nature, has no power to understand what is right or wrong
          in God's dispensations; that what we call goodness and virtue in
          unregenerate minds is not so in God's sight; that every act of
          every unrenewed mind is sin, and only sin; that until regenerated
          we never do any thing to move God to re-create our ruined nature;
          all this in its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          hopelessness and neglect of all virtuous efforts, as useless in
          regard to our highest interests. As before intimated, these
          tendencies are more or less counteracted by the teachings of common
          sense and the Bible. Still, such tendencies must always be, more or
          less, effective and disastrous.</p>

        powerful as to insure <span class="tei tei-q">“sin, and only

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The great point
        taught by Dr. Nettleton and his associates was, that man has a
        depraved nature consisting in a bias or propensity to sin, consequent
        on Adam's sin, for which we are <span class="tei tei-q">“awfully
        criminal in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page249">[pg
        249]</span><a name="Pg249" id="Pg249" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the
        sight of God,”</span> and which man himself will never remedy; that
        regeneration consists in the change of this bias by God, and that
        until God does make this change man will <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“never give his heart to God nor make one holy
        choice.”</span> And yet his sermons, as the writer heard them month
        after month, abounded in pungent addresses to sinners, commanding
        them in God's name to <span class="tei tei-q">“give their hearts to
        God,”</span> and maintaining that their inability to do so was owing
        to their own fault and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">unwillingness</span></em> to do so.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the same time,
        the New Haven divines, in the same pulpit, were urging <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">their</span></em>
        views, showing that regeneration consisted in <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“choosing God and his service;”</span> that man was fully
        able to do this, and yet that owing to his depraved nature, he never
        would do it, until that nature was in some way changed by God.
        Meantime, on their view also, every voluntary act, previous to
        regeneration, was <span class="tei tei-q">“sin, and only sin.”</span>
        Nor had God pointed out any sure mode of obtaining from him the gift
        of regenerating grace. They, however, urged that the results of
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">experience</span></em> proved that regeneration,
        though not promised to unregenerate doings, is, as a matter of fact,
        bestowed more frequently on those who use <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the means of grace,”</span> such as prayer, reading the
        Bible and frequenting religious meetings, than on those who do
        not.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The points of
        difference between the New Haven theologians and their opponents,
        seemed to be, that the former taught that regeneration was the act of
        man himself in choosing God's service; while Dr. Nettleton and his
        associates taught that it consisted in the change of man's <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em> by
        God, and not in what was done by man himself. The New Haven
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page250">[pg 250]</span><a name="Pg250"
        id="Pg250" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> theologians have been more
        definite in their attempts to explain the exact nature of
        regeneration than any other class. They all agree, however, that man
        never will, in any case, become regenerated until God in some measure
        rectifies the injury done to human nature by Adam's sin; that God
        points out no definite way to secure this aid; and that previous to
        regeneration every moral act of man is <span class="tei tei-q">“sin,
        and only sin.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As to the signs or
        evidence of regeneration, those who teach that man's depravity
        consists in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">deprivation</span></em> of God's Spirit, on
        account of Adam's sin, often lead to the expectation of some sudden
        <span class="tei tei-q">“light and joy,”</span> as the first evidence
        of regeneration. Such, also, follow Wesley's direction, and try to
        believe that they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">are</span></em> justified and sanctified, in
        order to become so. Others point out certain emotions toward God or
        toward Jesus Christ as the proof of the commencement of a new
        nature.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some divines lead
        to the impression that the new nature consists in a mysterious
        indwelling of God in the soul, or a union of our nature to his, so
        that when it takes place, there is a natural outflowing of good
        feelings and good works, as there was of evil before this union. But
        they point out no intelligible way of gaining this union.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Catholic
        church teaches that regeneration is conferred by the rite of baptism,
        and that thus a seed or some mysterious principle is implanted, which
        is developed by use of the forms and rites of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the church,”</span> and exhibited in <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“good works.”</span> The Episcopal churches, more or
        less, retain this view in the teachings of their clergy.</p>

        will make a collection of the various diverse explanations of this
        indispensable requisite to eternal life, it would prove a most

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This extract is
        not given as a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">correct</span></em> exhibition of the views of
        this author, for it may not do him justice. It is given to show how
        vague and indefinite are the teachings of religious writers and
        preachers on this subject. Here is a book recommended for its
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">clear
        views</span></em> by the highest class of minds. It is read and
        re-read by an intelligent, well-educated young man, who is studying
        theology in one of our first seminaries. He then gives this author's
        view of regeneration, as that which he supposes to be contained in
        that book, and also as <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the one generally
        entertained</span></em>.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And what is this
        answer to the great question, <span class="tei tei-q">“What must we
        do to be saved?”</span>—a question on which the happiness of endless
        ages is suspended.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">It is the pardon of

        entire.”</span> This is something which God does, and this, as it
        would seem, is regeneration.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next it is stated
        that <span class="tei tei-q">“the moment a soul <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">believes in Christ
        and accepts his atonement</span></em>, that moment it experiences
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a complete
        sense of pardoned sin</span></em>.”</span> Here one <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page253">[pg 253]</span><a name="Pg253" id="Pg253"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> must ask, <span class="tei tei-q">“what
        is signified by believing in Christ and accepting his atonement? Is
        this also regeneration, and if so, does it consist in the
        intellectual assent to the proposition that Christ as God suffered
        and died, and by this act secured the pardon of our sin?”</span>
        There is nothing given to decide these queries.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next, it is stated
        that this act of faith is followed by <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">a complete sense</span></em> of pardoned
        sin.”</span> Is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">this</span></em> regeneration, or is it a
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">part</span></em> of it? There is nothing given
        to decide this question.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is certain that
        the young man, totally failed in his efforts to secure any <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">clear</span></em> and
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">definite</span></em> conceptions of the author's
        meaning, exactly as has been the case with the writer herself, for
        whom the above extract was prepared.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been the
        privilege of the writer, often to listen to the preaching of Dr.
        Bushnell, one of the most popular of all our religious teachers. On
        one such occasion during the present season, the object of his sermon
        seemed to be to teach what was that <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">true knowledge of
        God</span></em>, which he urged on his hearers.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He stated that it
        was not merely an intellectual apprehension of his character and
        deeds, but something which every soul must gain in order to secure
        eternal life, something, as it seemed, which he deemed <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">regeneration</span></em>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He finally
        enunciated this, which seemed to be his idea of this indispensable
        experience: <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">It is the return of
        God into the human soul</span></em>.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In enlarging on
        this, he described something which was so vague and indefinite as to
        make it useless to attempt to state the impression made. Afterward,
        aid was sought from one of the preacher's constant and <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page254">[pg 254]</span><a name="Pg254" id="Pg254"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> most intelligent hearers. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Does Dr. Bushnell believe in a preëxistent state, when
        God, in the manner set forth, was <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in</span></em> the
        soul of each human being? If not, what does he mean by a <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘return of God into the soul?’</span> ”</span> After some
        discussion, this intelligent parishioner concluded that his meaning
        probably was, that when we desire and intend wholly to submit our
        wills to that of God, and to be guided wholly by him, we become in
        this respect <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">one</span></em> with God. And this is what is
        meant by God's <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">return</span></em> into the soul. At what
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">previous</span></em> time this state of union
        was experienced, and then lost, so that regeneration is its
        <span class="tei tei-q">“return,”</span> seemed to remain, as it
        respects information to be gained from parishioners, a matter of
        hopeless speculation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In a family of
        whom eight are ministers of religion, and several are theological
        professors, the one who has seemed most fully to agree with the
        writer in explaining the nature of regeneration, is the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Star contributor to the
        Independent</span></span>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been shown
        that Phrenology is antagonistic to the Augustinian theory of
        implanted evil propensities, by teaching that every faculty, when
        developed and regulated aright, tends to the best good of the race,
        so that the extinction of any faculty or propensity would not be an
        improvement, but rather an injury to the constitution of mind.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In regard to this
        brother, here referred to, the system of Phrenology was embraced by
        him before his theological education was commenced, and was never
        relinquished. In consequence, his mode of explaining the nature of
        regeneration has been diverse from most accepted methods of
        theological schools. And <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg
        255]</span><a name="Pg255" id="Pg255" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        yet, when the writer, applied both to his published articles and to
        some of his most intelligent, regular hearers, to ascertain if the
        common-sense view of regeneration, as here stated, was in perfect
        agreement with her brother's views, it seemed difficult to
        decide.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In reading some of
        the Star Papers, the common-sense view of regeneration is clear and
        unmistakable; in others, there are statements as to the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">distinctive</span></em> nature of Christian
        character, which seem to be both additional and diverse. The result
        is, an uncertainty as to the exact idea of what regeneration consists
        in, as taught by this brother.<a id="noteref_19" name="noteref_19"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let this
        statement, by the Independent, of what the new birth consists in, as
        held by the fathers and mothers of New England, be compared with the
        preceding account of <span class="tei tei-q">“conversion,”</span>
        given by a young theologian, born in Connecticut, and educated at
        Yale <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page256">[pg 256]</span><a name=
        "Pg256" id="Pg256" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> College, as the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“generally entertained one,”</span> and the
        case is rendered increasingly difficult and perplexing.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the view of the
        author, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">all</span></em> theologians do so far hold the
        common-sense theory of regeneration, that when they find a person
        whose will seems to be entirely subjected to the will of God, while
        <span class="tei tei-q">“under the influence of love and gratitude to
        Him, and guided by faith in his teachings, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">living chiefly for
        the great commonwealth takes the place of living chiefly for
        self</span></em>”</span>—such a person is regarded by them as
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">regenerated</span></em>. At the same time, bound
        by the Augustine system, they give other views of the nature of
        regeneration, which are vague and conflicting, as has been
        illustrated in the preceding pages.<a id="noteref_20" name=
        "noteref_20" href="#note_20"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From all this
        results endless anxiety, doubt and distress, in conscientious minds,
        from uncertainty whether their depraved nature has been changed, and
        from perplexity in view of the multifarious modes of teaching in
        regard to the nature and signs of regeneration.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From this, too,
        results false confidence and indifference to right and wrong conduct,
        in those who imagine they discover in themselves the signs of a
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg 257]</span><a name="Pg257"
        id="Pg257" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> regenerated nature, which
        will, as they are led to believe, secure heaven without reference to
        the amount of good or evil deeds.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This same
        incertitude as to what regeneration is, has also tended to induce the
        fanaticism, extravagance and absurdities often connected with
        religious excitements.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The idea that
        there is to be some mysterious change in the soul by the gift of
        God's Spirit; that this is to be gained by prayer; that the evidence
        of this change is to be found in sudden and great mental agitation;
        together with the belief that an <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eternity</span></em>
        of misery or bliss is depending on such a change; and that death is
        the end of all hope—all this tends to great extremes of distress and
        excitement.</p>

          System.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In contrast to
          these tendencies of the Augustinian system, in regard to individual
          religious experience, we notice those of the common-sense system.
          According to the latter, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">first birth</span></em> brings man into
          existence as an undeveloped being, with perfect and wonderful
          capacities of knowledge, enjoyment and self-control. The first
          period of existence is necessarily a period of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">experimenting</span></em>, in which mind is
          dependent on others for most of the knowledge indispensable to
          right action, and also for the training of the physical, social and
          moral habits. It is impossible to choose aright, intelligently,
          until a child learns <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">what is right</span></em>, and this is a slow
          and gradual process. In some cases, by a careful training, early
          virtuous principles and habits may be so induced, that there can
          not be any marked period in which the mind comes <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg 258]</span><a name="Pg258" id="Pg258"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> under the control of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a ruling
          purpose</span></em> to obey all the rules of rectitude as disclosed
          by reason and experience, or by revelations from God.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In other cases,
          the child may grow up to manhood entirely unregulated by any such
          purpose, while self-gratification, unrestrained by rules, is the
          perpetual aim. In such cases, a sudden change, in which the man
          forms and carries out a ruling purpose to act righteously and
          virtuously, in all his relations to man, to God and to himself, may
          take place. This change, in the language of common life, would be
          expressed thus: <span class="tei tei-q">“The man has begun a new
          life; he is a new creature.”</span> And by a figurative use of
          language, the change might be called <span class="tei tei-q">“a new
          birth,”</span> or, in theological language, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“regeneration.”</span> In such a case, the chief desire
          or ruling passion would be, to discover and to obey all the
          physical, social and moral laws of the Creator, as they are taught
          by reason and experience, or by revelations from God.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such an
          experience would be properly expressed by the terms, <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">faith</span></em>
          in God, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">love</span></em> to God, <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">repentance</span></em> toward God, <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as these terms are
          used by men in common life</span></em>. Thus <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“regeneration,”</span> according to the common-sense
          system, becomes an intelligible, rational and practical matter.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In case of a
          revelation from God by a prophet or messenger, confidence in, and
          obedience to, the teachings of that messenger, would be practical
          or saving faith, both in God and in his messenger also. Thus, if
          Christ is proved to be a messenger from God by miracles, whoever
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">practically believes</span></em> in Christ,
          believes in God also. And just so far as a man understands Christ's
          teachings <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">aright</span></em>, and <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">purposes</span></em> to obey him, <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page259">[pg 259]</span><a name="Pg259" id="Pg259"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">carries
          out</span></em> this purpose, just so far he has faith, and love,
          and repentance toward God and toward Christ. And as men are named
          by the name of those they obey, every man is a <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">true
          Christian</span></em> just so far as he understands Christ's
          teachings <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">aright</span></em> and <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">obeys</span></em>
          them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this view of
          the case, the true <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">signs of
          regeneration</span></em>”</span> would be each person's
          consciousness of the great end and purpose of his life, and the
          fruits or results of this purpose in an habitual obedience to the
          physical, social and moral laws of God, as learned by reason,
          experience and revelation. Thus the answer to the great question of
          life becomes clear, harmonious and practical, furnishing the means
          for every person to judge of his own character and prospects.</p>

        Systems in Reference to the Character of God.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been shown
        (<a href="#Chapter_24" class="tei tei-ref">chapter 24</a>) that
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">emotive</span></em> love, in view of noble and
        interesting traits of character, affords a most powerful motive in
        securing <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">voluntary love</span></em> or <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good
        willing</span></em> according to the laws of God. This is the grand
        reason why it is so important that all his creatures should regard
        their Creator, whose laws they must obey, as perfect in every noble
        and lovable quality. This would render it easy and delightful to obey
        his will.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The principle of
        gratitude is the strongest in our nature, in calling forth desires to
        please another. This <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg
        260]</span><a name="Pg260" id="Pg260" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        renders it so important that we should regard our Maker, not only as
        noble and lovely, but as the dispenser of innumerable and constant
        favors to ourselves and to those whom we love.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The highest
        emotions of love and gratitude are evoked when a noble and lovely
        benefactor condescends to humiliation, suffering, and even to death
        to rescue from great calamity. And the greater the danger and
        suffering from which this goodness rescues, the stronger the
        gratitude and the desire to please the benefactor.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this view we
        can conceive of no way in which our Creator could so powerfully
        influence his creatures to virtuous self-sacrifice for the general
        good in obedience to his laws, as by such an exhibition on his
        part.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been shown
        [<a href="#Chapter_28" class="tei tei-ref">Chapter 28</a>] that by
        the light of reason and experience alone, we infer that our race are
        exposed to dreadful risk and danger of evils, which to <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">some</span></em> will
        prove interminable. If, then, it can be made to appear that our
        Creator has submitted to great humiliation and suffering to rescue
        us, and that his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">chief desire</span></em> is that his creatures
        should obey his beneficent laws, the strongest conceivable motives
        would be secured to lead to glad obedience to the rules of virtue.
        And having shown that the chief end of our Creator is to do all in
        his power to make the most possible happiness, we should infer that
        he had made or would make such a manifestation of his character to
        his creatures. And were this revealed to us as done, such a
        revelation would properly be called <span class="tei tei-q">“glad
        tidings,”</span> as that which was best fitted to save men from sin
        and suffering.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page261">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to the
        system of common sense, our Creator is presented as the Almighty
        Father, who forms each finite mind an embryo image of his own all
        perfect mind, with the great design of making all the happiness
        possible. Although the highest happiness of each and of all, depends
        on the perfect action of every mind, such action is not possible in
        the nature of things except as a knowledge of his laws and of the
        motives to secure obedience are made known by finite educators, who
        must first be trained themselves by a long and slow process. Thus
        every mind is dependent for its final success in attaining perfect
        obedience to law, and for perfected happiness, on God, on finite
        educators and on self.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In carrying
        forward the development and education of our race, the Creator always
        has done and always will do the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">best that is possible</span></em> for the good
        of all. And yet, so far as reason and experience teach, some will be
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ruined for
        ever</span></em>. The deteriorating process begun in this life, and
        its baleful results, will continue for ever.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The great
        consummation, when those that are hopelessly ruined will be separated
        from the good, is at an indefinite period ahead, and may be many
        ages, while the same process of labor and training are proceeding in
        the unseen world, and yet so that the conduct and character formed in
        this life have a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">decided influence</span></em> on the whole
        course of existence that follows.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus when the good
        man dies we may hope that his upward career is eternally secure. But
        when the wicked die there must be <span class="tei tei-q">“a certain
        fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Creator does,
        has done, and will do <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        in human form as a teacher of his laws, an example of virtue and a
        self-sacrificing Saviour, we infer that he has done or will do this,
        at the time and in the manner which is best fitted to the great end
        in view.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Augustinian
        system presents a view of the character and conduct of the Creator in
        mournful contrast to this.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our only idea of a
        perfectly benevolent being is that of one who prefers happiness to
        suffering, and who does <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">all in his power</span></em> to promote one and
        prevent the other. Our only idea of a malevolent being is, that he
        wills misery when he has full power to make happiness in its stead.
        Our only evidence of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">moral</span></em> character of a being (or that
        exhibited in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">willing</span></em>) is <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
        nature</span></em> of his works. On the Augustinian theory, all the
        chief works of the Creator's hand, the immortal minds, which alone
        give value to any other existences, are depraved so totally that
        there is no really good act done by any one of them till created
        anew.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In other words,
        the Creator, having full power to make every mind perfect in nature,
        and who still has power to re-create all with perfect natures, has
        instituted a system by which the sin of one man entails a depraved
        nature on a whole race, while the evil as yet has been remedied only
        in the case of a small, <span class="tei tei-q">“elect”</span>
        number. All the rest are doomed to eternal misery for conduct which
        is the certain consequence of this misformed nature.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To save men from
        the punishment of the sins consequent <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        perfect and only unsinning being that ever visited earth, undergoes
        deep humiliation and excruciating sufferings.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To call such

        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        blessings are all the comforts and enjoyments of this life, so soon
        to be snatched away, thus making the contrast of future misery so
        much the more horrible? What mercy is there in any mode of rectifying
        a wrong so needlessly inflicted? What mercy, or what justice is there
        in adding to all the miseries of our race the sufferings of so noble
        and lovely a being as Jesus Christ, when all, and more than all,
        effected by his agonies, could be so much more justly and reasonably
        secured by regenerating all the minds thus needlessly ruined in their
        nature? This strange and mysterious transaction only adds to the
        terror and gloom that shroud such a Creator, whose character can be
        learned only by the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">nature</span></em> of his works.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To call all this a
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">mystery</span></em> is a misuse of terms, for
        there is no mystery about it. More direct, clear, and open injustice,
        folly and malevolence, can not possibly be expressed in human
        language than that here set forth and ascribed to God.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Every mind
        instinctively asks, why did not the Creator give us a perfect nature
        when he has the power to do so? Why does he not stop all the sin and
        misery resulting from the depraved nature of man by regenerating all,
        when he has power to do so? How can we either respect or love a being
        who <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page264">[pg 264]</span><a name=
        "Pg264" id="Pg264" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> has done such awful
        and endless wrong to our race, and for no conceivable good made known
        to us? What cause of gratitude for the sufferings and death of Christ
        to save the few of us who alone are to escape from such needless and
        intolerable evils?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meantime, the
        various theories invented to relieve the baleful impression thus made
        as to the character of our Creator, only add new difficulties.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To say that this
        perpetuated mode of bringing ruined minds into existence, is a
        penalty for a single sin of the first pair, thousands of years ago,
        what a violation of all our ideas of justice! To say that this
        transaction is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        that he <span class="tei tei-q">“imputes”</span> the sin of the
        father to all his descendants, what is this, to our conceptions, but
        puerile folly added to the baldest cruelty and injustice?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To say that we all
        <span class="tei tei-q">“sinned <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        before we were born, and are punished by a ruined nature, so far as
        we can conceive of such an absurd proposition, what is this penalty
        better than inflicting endless tortures on myriads of new-born
        infants for their first ignorant and unconscious sin?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To say that
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">man</span></em>, or <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Adam</span></em> is
        the author of all this ineffable wrong, because it is done by
        <span class="tei tei-q">“a constitutional transmission”</span> from
        parent to child, of which God is the author, when he had full power
        to make each child perfect in nature, what is this but adding to
        cruelty and injustice a mean subterfuge in order to cast the blame on
        Adam and his race?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The mind turns
        from a God so represented, with horror and dismay, and it is only by

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The view of God's
        character thus presented by the Augustinian theory, not only lessens
        the power of motive which the common-sense view of the Creator's
        character affords, but brings a powerful positive influence to turn
        the human mind from that love and obedience toward God which is so
        indispensable to peace and happiness.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been shown
        that the common-sense theory teaches that all mankind must, in order
        to eternal happiness, be trained by human agencies to choose what is
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">best</span></em>, guided by the laws of God, as
        learned by experience or by revelation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Under the guidance
        of this general principle, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">associated</span></em> bodies would result,
        whose aim would be discussion and instruction to discover and
        perpetuate a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">knowledge</span></em> of the rules of rectitude,
        and to secure all those <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">motives</span></em> which experience has proved
        to be most effective in securing obedience to these rules. In other
        words, the chief end of such associations would be to find out what
        is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">best</span></em> and thus right, and also the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">best</span></em> modes of securing right
        action.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The experience of
        mankind has shown that the most effective way to extend and
        perpetuate any religion is to have a body of men supported who shall
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page266">[pg 266]</span><a name="Pg266"
        id="Pg266" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> give their chief energies and
        time to this object. Social gatherings at regular periods have also
        been found effective to this end. In short, were a system of religion
        established, founded <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">exclusively</span></em> and <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">consistently</span></em> on experience and
        common sense, it would include sabbaths of interrupted worldly
        affairs, social gatherings to promote worshipful obedience to the
        Creator and a body of men educated and sustained for the express
        purpose of discovering, instructing in and perpetuating the
        intellectual, social, moral and religious interests of humanity. Such
        a ministry would be not dogmatic teachers, but leaders in discussions
        and investigations.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The great aim of
        all these arrangements would be to discover by inquiry and discussion
        what is best in all human interests and affairs, in view of the
        immortality of man, and the risks and dangers of eternity, and also
        to devise the best modes of influencing all to right action.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Were this life the
        end of our being, and were all questions of right and wrong to be
        settled in reference to the well-being of our race in this short
        span, no such separate class of religious leaders and organized
        instrumentalities would be needful. But if men are to be <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">trained</span></em>
        to act with reference to the invisible state as the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">chief</span></em>
        concern, then organized instrumentalities to resist the overruling
        tide of worldliness become indispensable.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The full
        tendencies of such organizations, based <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">exclusively</span></em> on the principles of
        common sense, must be a matter of speculation merely, for the world
        has had no experience of this kind. As yet we have only the
        experience of mankind as to systems in which the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg 267]</span><a name="Pg267" id="Pg267"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> teachings of common sense have been
        combined with contradictory influences of false dogmas, which have
        been sustained by the strongest organizations, civil and
        ecclesiastical.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We will now trace
        some of the tendencies of the Augustinian system as they have been
        exhibited in the history of church organizations.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been shown
        that the Augustinian theory of a depraved nature is the foundation
        doctrine alike of the Catholic and the Protestant churches. All agree
        that man by nature is so miserably misformed that the gift of the
        Holy Spirit purchased by Christ to re-create is his sole hope of
        escape from everlasting perdition, while there is little or no
        ability to understand or obey God's revealed will until this gift is
        imparted. From this originated a priesthood as the medium through
        which this renewing gift is to be obtained, and who are the only
        authorized interpreters of God's revealed will. The transmission of
        this power through the rite of ordination, preserved in direct
        succession from the apostles, is the leading point in the Episcopal
        organization. Still more is this carried out to extreme results in
        the Catholic church.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Both organizations
        assume that <span class="tei tei-q">“the church”</span> which has
        this power, does not include <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">the people</span></em>, but is the priesthood
        alone. It is the ecclesiastics of these churches who are to interpret
        the Bible for the people, and the people are to receive these
        decisions as from God. This is the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">theory</span></em>,
        while common sense and the Bible have more or less modified its
        practical adoption, especially in the Episcopal churches.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Puritans of
        England were the first among the Protestants who organized churches
        as consisting solely <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page268">[pg
        268]</span><a name="Pg268" id="Pg268" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of
        those who <span class="tei tei-q">“profess”</span> to be <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“regenerated”</span> on the theory of the renewal of the
        depraved nature derived from Adam. To this profession in most cases
        must be added an examination by persons who are regenerated in order
        to ascertain whether the true signs of a new nature, according to
        their pattern, really exist. Such churches are a close corporation,
        having a minister to preach and administer baptism and the sacrament
        of the Lord's Supper, and deacons, elders, or committees to decide
        who shall be received as regenerate or turned out as
        unregenerate.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the Puritans
        and their descendants originated another practice which has become
        prevalent, by which the churches thus organized as regenerated
        persons, also claim the right of infallible interpreters of the
        Bible, so far as to exclude all from their communion who do not
        profess to agree with their interpretations. That is to say, all
        persons, in order to be admitted to their corporation and to the
        Lord's table, must not only profess to be regenerate in the nature
        transmitted from Adam, but must confess that they interpret the Bible
        according to the notions of the church they seek to join.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will now be
        shown that most of our large denominations in this country are so
        founded on the Augustinian dogma that were <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
        people</span></em> all to give up this theory the whole basis of
        sectarianism would be destroyed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Congregational
        and Baptist denominations are severed simply in reference to the rite
        of baptism as the mode of admission to their regenerated churches.
        The Congregationalists hold that baptism should be administered by
        sprinkling, and to the infants of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page269">[pg 269]</span><a name="Pg269" id="Pg269" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> church members as well as to adults joining the
        church. The Baptists hold that baptism should be administered by
        immersion, and only to adults who join the church. This is all that
        divides the two sects.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of course, if all
        the people ceased to hold that churches are to consist of persons
        whose nature received from Adam is re-created, all churches
        associated on the theory would be ended, and so these disputes about
        modes of admission would be ended.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, the
        Presbyterians and Congregationalists separate on the question of the
        appointment and duties of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">officers</span></em> of their churches. The
        Congregationalists manage by church committees. Each church is the
        sole tribunal in its own affairs, thus being strictly democratic. The
        Presbyterian churches manage the business of each church by
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sessions</span></em> or <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">elders</span></em>
        appointed by the church, and when they fail to give satisfaction, an
        appeal is made to a Presbytery consisting of ministers and elders of
        several churches.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus again, if
        churches organized on the Augustine theory of the regeneration of a
        depraved nature should cease, this dispute in regard to <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">church
        officers</span></em> would end, and the Presbyterians,
        Congregationalists, and Baptists would find all ground for separation
        gone.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, the old and
        new school Presbyterian churches separate on questions relating to
        man's ability to regenerate himself and in regard to what is the
        nature of regeneration.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This all depends
        on the fact of a depraved nature transmitted from Adam to be
        regenerated. If this dogma is relinquished by the people then these
        two sects will have no ground for division.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, the
        Methodists differ from the other Augustinian <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page270">[pg 270]</span><a name="Pg270" id="Pg270" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> sects chiefly in regard to the officers and
        management of churches organized on the theory of a depraved nature
        received from Adam, which is to be regenerated. And if such
        organizations were ended the ground of separation between the
        Methodists and the preceding sects would be removed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, the
        Episcopalian sect is founded on the idea of a succession of ordained
        priests through whose agency the gift of God's Spirit to renew our
        depraved nature and to impart the true interpretation of his
        revelations is to be obtained.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If, then, the
        people discard the dogma of a depraved nature consequent on Adam's
        sin, and assume that they have perfect natures, and are authorized to
        interpret the Bible for themselves, the chief ground for the
        existence of this as a separate sect will be removed. The Catholic
        church also would soon be ended as a distinct sect were all the
        people of that church to discard these and all opinions and practices
        immediately or remotely based on the Augustinian dogma.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The preceding will
        serve to illustrate the position that the tendency of the
        common-sense system is to unite all men in efforts to discover and to
        obey all the laws of God for making happiness the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">best</span></em> way
        for time and eternity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the contrary,
        the Augustinian system tends to organize mankind into sects
        contending, not for truth and happiness, but for certain outward
        rites and forms of organization.</p>

        Spirit.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The result of
        receiving <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">church</span></em> interpretations as
        infallible, whether of priests or regenerated laity, is the
        assumption of a similar infallibility by each person who thus accepts
        them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is
        accomplished by a very singular fallacy, thus:</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The regularly
        ordained priests, or the regenerated priests and laity of the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">true</span></em> church, are claimed to be the
        only persons qualified to understand and interpret the meaning of
        God's revelations. The question then is, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which is the true
        church</span></em>? The Catholic says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Mine,
        and no other.”</span> The Episcopalian says, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Mine, and no other;”</span> and so says the
        Presbyterian. The result is, each man decides that the true church is
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the one
        that agrees with his views of what the Bible teaches</span></em>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having thus
        decided that the church that agrees with himself is the true church,
        the man proceeds, not only to receive reverently the decisions of his
        church, but assumes that every other man is bound to do the same.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Catholic
        receives one set of interpretations from the church that he himself
        has infallibly decided to be the true church. The Protestant receives
        the creeds and confessions of the church he has infallibly decided to
        be the true church, whose regenerated ministers and members are
        qualified to understand the Bible, as no unregenerated man can
        do.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Being thus
        sustained by his own claims as a regenerated <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page272">[pg 272]</span><a name="Pg272" id="Pg272" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> person, and also by the claims of the church he
        adopts as the true one, there is little foundation for poverty of
        spirit, humility and meekness. How can a man feel <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“poor in spirit,”</span> as destitute of the knowledge
        requisite for right action, when he has his own regenerated mind and
        the guidance of the regenerated true church? How can a man be meek
        when others strive to enlighten him by showing that he is in the
        wrong, especially when such efforts are those of the unregenerated,
        or those shut out of his true church?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">How can a man
        become very humble and lowly in his own conceit, when, in contrast
        with most of the world, he alone can feel and act virtuously or
        understand truly God's revelations?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The natural
        tendency to pride, self-sufficiency and dogmatism is still further
        increased by the assumption that humility consists mainly in a low
        opinion of <span class="tei tei-q">“the nature”</span> with which we
        are endowed. Thus, while assuming infallibility in one aspect, they
        still can claim to be humble and lowly, because they abhor and
        despise their depraved nature and its results in themselves.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the same time,
        the most remarkable self-deception is practiced in regard to their
        own Christian graces. These all being supposed to spring from a
        regenerated nature imparted by God, they disclaim all honor or merit,
        and give all the glory to God, who has wrought these graces from
        their dead and sinful nature. By this method they imagine they attain
        a true humility and lowliness of spirit.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But every man of
        great genius, and every woman of uncommon beauty, understand as truly
        as the professedly regenerated person, that their gifts are from
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page273">[pg 273]</span><a name="Pg273"
        id="Pg273" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> God, and are willing to give
        all the glory to him for thus distinguishing them from their
        fellow-creatures. And the ascription of all the power and glory to
        God does not save the professedly regenerated person from
        self-complacency and pride any more than it does the genius or the
        beauty.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And yet we find
        religious writings abounding in such disclaimers and ascriptions,
        which are evidently regarded as proofs of humility and lowliness of
        spirit. It is true that such expressions do often flow from the
        hearts of the really humble and contrite; but the fact that a person
        regards and acknowledges God as the author of his own extraordinary
        gifts, that raise him above his fellows, is no <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">proof</span></em> of
        humility, while it is often so regarded.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In contrast to
        this tendency of the Augustinian system, the common-sense view
        teaches that while our nature is noble and perfect in
        construction—the embryo image of its Maker—it is destitute of that
        knowledge, experience and training, for which it is equally dependent
        on God and on man. And as the requisite knowledge can be gained only
        by the aid of those minds around, whose happiness is affected by our
        conduct, it is clear that a willingness to learn from any quarter and
        to be told our mistakes by any person, is the natural result of an
        earnest desire to find out and obey the truth. And a consciousness of
        our own liabilities to mistakes, and a certainty that there is no one
        <span class="tei tei-q">“that liveth and sinneth not,”</span> tends
        to induce compassionate sympathy for the failings of others, and an
        indisposition to force opinions on them by any other mode than calm
        statement and argument.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the same time,
        an earnest desire for inquiry and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page274">[pg 274]</span><a name="Pg274" id="Pg274" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> discussion is generated, which naturally leads
        to patient investigation, courteous demeanor towards opponents, and
        to all the graces that wait on a gentle, humble and truth-loving
        spirit.</p>

        Systems in Regard to Dogmatism, Persecution and Ecclesiastical
        Tyranny.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been shown
        that the Augustinian system, teaching as it does man's depraved
        nature and destitution of any principles of right guidance in his own
        mind, makes him wholly dependent not only on revelations from his
        Creator, but on infallible interpreters.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus we find that
        wherever this system became dominant there has coëxisted the claim
        that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
        people</span></em> are not to decide, each one for himself, what are
        the teachings of reason, experience and revelation as to truth and
        duty. Instead of this, first it was popes and councils, in which the
        laity had no voice; next, as among the Puritans, it was the church,
        including both the clergy and the regenerated portion of their
        flocks.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From this resulted
        religious persecutions, in this manner: Men are to obey God as their
        first duty. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">The church</span></em> is God's mouth-piece to
        interpret his commands to mankind. If men refuse to obey God,
        speaking through his church, they must be forced to do so by pains
        and penalties. And as in view of eternal happiness and eternal
        misery, all earthly interests <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page275">[pg 275]</span><a name="Pg275" id="Pg275" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> are as nothing, every temporal consideration
        must be put out of account. Moreover, whoever leads men to disobey
        the church and thus to disobey God, and so to peril not only their
        own eternal welfare, but that of others, commits a greater crime than
        is done by violating any human ordinances. Therefore, the heaviest
        penalties should be employed to enforce obedience to the church, and
        the church must take precedence of the civil government.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus it came to
        pass that the more sincere, conscientious and benevolent a person
        was, while holding these views, the more surely would he become a
        persecutor.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The pages of
        history give many mournful illustrations of this truth. One of the
        most striking will be here introduced.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Isabella of Spain,
        by whose generosity this western world was discovered, was one of the
        most gentle, conscientious, benevolent and lovely characters that
        ever adorned a throne.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She was trained to
        believe the church to be the representative of God on earth, and her
        father confessor, Torquemada, the originator of the Inquisition, was
        the guide of her conscience. By his commands the Inquisition reared
        its horrid dungeons. By his counsel the industrious, cultivated and
        chivalrous Moors, the most useful of all her subjects, were driven
        from their native soil. By his commands the Jews were brought to the
        cruel alternative of giving up their religion or relinquishing all
        that made life dear. And thus the historian narrates this dreadful
        tale of religious persecution:</p>

          been before. Shunned by the middle classes, they intermarried with
          the 'blue blood' of the nobility, they entered the priesthood, and
          ascended the highest steps of the Catholic hierarchy. Nay, they

          break all the rules of life, dear from the nursery and clung to on

          cruelty was shown. Their woes were very piteous to see. The first
          who starved were the infants at the breast; then the mothers,
          carrying their dead children till they fell down and died with
          them. Many perished of cold and of squalor. Unused to the sea,
          countless numbers died from sickness; many were drowned by the
          sailors for their wealth; the poor, who could not otherwise pay
          their passage, sold their children. Lean, pale, with eyes
          deep-sunken, like ghosts from the dead, hardly moving enough to
          show that they were alive, they came into our city to find shelter
          for three days; for our ancient laws forbade a longer stay. Yet for
          the repair of their ships, and for health's sake, a short respite
          was granted. They were allowed to live on the Mole, while they made
          ready for their long voyage eastward. Thus the winter</span>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This mournful
        narrative exhibits one of the most sublime examples of religious
        faith and conscientious self-sacrifice to what was deemed truth and
        duty in the persecuted. At the same time, when the avaricious
        Ferdinand relinquished thirty thousand ducats, and the tender and
        benevolent Isabella turned a deaf ear to such prayers and sufferings
        from her people, there can be no doubt that conscience ruled the
        persecutors also. Even Torquemada himself may have been acting from
        the most conscientious and benevolent motives in all the disastrous
        influences he brought to bear on his royal mistress.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This passage of
        history also teaches that honesty, and sincerity, and
        conscientiousness will not avail without a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knowledge of the
        truth</span></em>. Nay, more; had these persecutors been less
        conscientious, the natural instincts of humanity or personal
        interests would have mitigated or withheld the cruel doom.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is in this
        light that we are enabled, in spite of their mistakes in opinions, to
        look upon theologians as among the noblest sufferers and confessors
        for what they believed to be truth. From the time of Augustine and
        Pelagius to the present day nothing can be more clear than that the
        combatants on both sides were actuated by a sincere love to God and
        to man, each believing, as sincerely as did Saul of Tarsus, that in
        these conflicts they were verily doing God service, and that all they
        were called to suffer was for the true church of God and the
        salvation of their fellow-men.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the main
        purpose for which this record of history <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page281">[pg 281]</span><a name="Pg281" id="Pg281" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> now appears is to illustrate the natural
        tendency of the Augustine theory in leading to dogmatism, persecution
        and ecclesiastical tyranny.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The tendency of
        the common-sense system can not be illustrated by history, for
        unfortunately Christendom has never yet had an opportunity to test by
        a fair experiment its true tendencies. We can only imagine what would
        be the results were all ecclesiastical restraints and teachings based
        on the Augustine theory removed from our pulpit ministries, our hymns
        and prayers, our religious literature, and, most of all, from long
        established habits of thought and feeling.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then all our
        religious organizations would have for their leading aim, not to
        maintain some outward rite or modes of organization, but to promote
        free discussion for the discovery of truth and harmonious coöperation
        to promote happiness according to the laws of God.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the ministry
        of the Word would be committed to men distinguished not only by
        natural endowments, acquired knowledge and skill in debate, but also
        ensamples to their flocks in the virtues of humility, meekness, and a
        gentle and teachable spirit. Then the points that would divide men
        into parties would be chiefly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">practical</span></em> questions, so that where
        no agreement in opinion could be secured, each would peaceably try a
        fair experiment and eventually bring the results forward for the
        general good.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then every
        individual would be free to protest against all that he believes to
        be injurious and wrong, in regard to individuals, to the family, to
        the church and to the state, and be met in his efforts as a
        benefactor rather than an opposer or an enemy.</p>

        <span style="font-size: 173%">Chapter XLII. Tendencies of the Two
        Systems as Shown in Controversy and Sects.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is the aim of
        this chapter to show that the chief controversies and chief sects of
        Christendom have resulted from the Angustinian system, and from
        attempts to eliminate it from the system of common sense with which
        it has been combined.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The dogma of a
        depraved nature consequent on Adam's sin, was a philosophical theory
        introduced to account for the prevailing sinfulness of the human
        race. The attempt of Pelagius and his associates to oppose this
        dogma, was met by civil and ecclesiastical power and persecution.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“And thus,”</span> says the historian,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the Gauls, Britons and Africans by their
        councils, and the emperors by their edicts, demolished this sect in
        its infancy and suppressed it entirely.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For long ages
        after this, no attempt was made to oppose the system based on this
        theory in any of its branches. The doctrine that man, being so
        depraved in nature as to be incapable of knowing or judging aright,
        and having no standard of right and wrong but express revelations
        from God, resulted in the unresisted claim of popes and church
        councils as the only authorized interpreters of the Bible.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then began the
        powerful influence of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">education</span></em>. Every child was trained
        to believe the doctrine of a depraved nature as a part of the word of
        God, to be received with unquestioning submission. Thus the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page283">[pg 283]</span><a name="Pg283"
        id="Pg283" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> most powerful influences were
        enlisted to enchain the feeble and plastic mind of childhood at the
        starting-point of thought and reason. It was also taught by
        theologians to all the young ecclesiastics as a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">system</span></em>,
        thus adding a new force to early educational training by the
        authority of the church, with all its solemn and awful sanctions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The idea that
        every man is to receive the teachings of Christ, uncontrolled by
        church authority, as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">he</span></em> understands them, and that he is
        a Christian just so far as he <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">understands aright</span></em> and <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">obeys</span></em>
        them, found no advocates for long centuries. Meantime the
        ecclesiastics, as the only infallible interpreters of God's word, and
        the only source by which to gain regenerating influences, abused the
        influence thus acquired, to build up the awful prelatic power that
        ruled Christendom for ages. At last, with many other abominations,
        the regular sale of indulgences to commit all manner of crimes at
        fixed prices, brought intolerable follies and crimes to a crisis.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Luther and
        his compeers arose and waged war, not against the root of these
        evils, but against those inevitable branches, the infallibility of
        church interpretations and the substitution of outward creeds, rites
        and forms for the spiritual principle of love to God and man
        exhibited by obedience to the Creator's laws.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Luther claimed
        that he and all men were bound to interpret the Bible for themselves,
        and not to submit their judgment to any pope, council or
        ecclesiastical power. And he claimed that the Bible teaches that man
        is to be saved [justified], not by outward forms, but <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by faith in Jesus
        Christ</span></em>. But retaining the doctrine <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page284">[pg 284]</span><a name="Pg284" id="Pg284"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of man's ruined and helpless <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em>,
        his ideas of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">faith</span></em> and of the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mode</span></em> of
        attaining it, were vague and conflicting. Thus originated the long
        conflict between Catholic and Protestant Christianity, involving some
        of the most bloody and cruel wars and persecutions that ever
        afflicted humanity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next came Arminius
        and his associates, who, still clinging to the fatal root of a
        totally depraved nature, labored to devise <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">some</span></em> way
        in which, in spite of this ruin, man could do something to secure
        regeneration from God. For, as shown in the early chapters, Calvinism
        maintained that man was utterly helpless, and that <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> the
        doings of the unregenerate were sin and only sin, and therefore
        utterly unavailing in gaining regenerating aid from God. Hence
        originated the long conflict between Calvinism and Arminianism, which
        has been continued to this day.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Both these schools
        of divinity rested on the dogma of an entirely depraved nature, but
        their tendencies were diverse.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Calvinism,
        maintaining the utter helplessness of man, tended to despairing
        inefficiency. If man really could do nothing, why should he attempt
        any thing to secure salvation?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the other hand,
        Arminianism, promising help through certain forms, rites and
        influences conveyed by ecclesiastics, tended to a reliance on rites
        and forms. If man is to be saved by these instrumentalities and can
        do nothing himself except through them, then, these being secured,
        the natural tendency must be to rest in them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These two diverse
        tendencies finally resulted in an equal torpor and indifference to
        religion in both parties, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page285">[pg
        285]</span><a name="Pg285" id="Pg285" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        which was interrupted on the Arminian side by Wesley and Whitfield,
        and on the Calvinistic side by Jonathan Edwards.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Wesley and his
        co-laborers taught anew the Protestant doctrine of man's independence
        of ecclesiastical interpretations and church forms, and the necessity
        of an immediate and higher spiritual life. From his efforts and those
        of Whitfield originated the great Methodist denomination in Great
        Britain and America.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this sect is
        carried out the theory of regeneration, not as a slow process of
        educational training, but as an instantaneous change, manifested in
        excited sensibilities. As the depravity consequent on Adam's sin
        consists in the <span class="tei tei-q">“deprivation”</span> of God's
        Spirit, and regeneration is the return of this gift, to be secured by
        prayer and other <span class="tei tei-q">“means of grace,”</span> we
        find their prayers, hymns and preaching all conformed to this theory.
        They gain grace when the Spirit comes, and when it departs they
        <span class="tei tei-q">“fall from grace.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While Wesley and
        Whitfield, in Great Britain, appealed directly to the people in
        combatting the Arminian tendency to forms and laxness, Jonathan
        Edwards addressed the leaders of metaphysical thought in his profound
        and acute writings. He attempted to meet the universal paralysis
        consequent on the Calvinistic doctrine of man's inability, amounting
        almost to the loss of a consciousness of personal freedom.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His aim was to
        restore to man a sense of ability and responsibility. Thus originated
        his theory of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">natural ability</span></em> and <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">moral
        inability</span></em>, which amounts simply to this: that man has
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">natural</span></em> power to obey all that God
        requires, but that he so lacks <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">moral ability</span></em>, on <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page286">[pg 286]</span><a name="Pg286" id="Pg286"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> account of his depraved nature, that it
        is certain that he never will make a truly virtuous choice till he is
        regenerated, and regeneration is not to be secured by any
        unregenerated doings.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From this resulted
        the division into the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">old</span></em> and <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">new-school
        Calvinistic</span></em> parties in the Congregational and
        Presbyterian churches.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lastly, the New
        Haven divines, while in some of their writings they held exactly the
        views of President Edwards, and claimed to have made no innovation,
        in others they came exactly to the Pelagian ground, maintaining that
        man <span class="tei tei-q">“has not a depraved nature <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in any
        sense</span></em>, nor a corrupt nature, much less a sinful
        nature,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“but rather that in nature he
        is like God.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is the same
        doctrine as was held by Pelagius, and if it were only carried out
        consistently and not contradicted, would be the entire elimination,
        root and branch, of the Augustinian system.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From this resulted
        a theological controversy that has agitated the Presbyterian and
        Congregational churches for the last thirty years.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are two
        denominations which all the Augustinian sects agree in excluding from
        their fellowship as not entitled to the name of Christian sects,
        which have had great influence in undermining the hold of the
        Augustinian theory. These are the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Universalists</span></em> and the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Unitarians</span></em>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The former do not
        formally deny the Augustinian theory of a depraved nature consequent
        on Adam's sin, but leaving it undisputed, gain great influence by it.
        They allow that God has power to restore man to his original
        perfectness, and then maintain that the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page287">[pg 287]</span><a name="Pg287" id="Pg287" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> very idea of a benevolent being, who is the
        loving parent of all his creatures, makes it certain that he will do
        so. For, as shown before, our only idea of a benevolent being is,
        that he <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">wills</span></em> to do <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all in his
        power</span></em> to secure that which will make the most happiness
        with the least evil. As, therefore, all the Augustinian sects concede
        that God has power to make all minds perfect at the first, and to
        regenerate all minds that are ruined through the sin of Adam,
        Universalists maintain that the very idea of the Creator as a
        benevolent being necessarily involves the certainty that he will in
        the end, bring all the creatures he has made to a state of
        perfectness, both in mental <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">construction</span></em> and mental <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">action</span></em>.
        This argument is unanswerable, and the people very extensively are
        led to so regard it, and to adopt this view of the future state of
        our race.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The question, with
        this sect, all turns on whether it is possible in the nature of
        things for God to construct mind on a more perfect pattern than that
        of the human mind; and whether it is possible, in the nature of
        things, to make the best possible system of minds that are free
        agents, and yet save <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">all</span></em> of them from perpetuated
        disobedience to the laws of that system and the consequent suffering
        of the natural penalties.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been shown
        that the common-sense system teaches that it is not possible, so that
        it must be by revelation only, that man could gain such a doctrine as
        the eventual perfect holiness and happiness of the whole human
        race.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While the
        Universalists gain great power by not contesting the Augustinian
        dogma, the Unitarians have taken the ground of a full recognition of
        the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page288">[pg 288]</span><a name=
        "Pg288" id="Pg288" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Pelagian doctrine of
        the perfect <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">construction</span></em> of the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em> of
        man. At the same time they have, as a sect, almost universally
        adopted the Universalist doctrine of the eventual salvation of the
        whole of our race.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Both these sects
        have embraced men of great popular talents, who have widely
        influenced the public mind, in their attempts to lessen confidence in
        the doctrines and sects based on the Augustinian theory.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meantime, in the
        scientific world, mental philosophy has made great progress in clear
        analysis and accurate definitions. The Scotch school of
        metaphysicians, headed by Reid and Stewart, have clearly developed
        and established in a popular form, the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">principles of
        reason</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">common sense</span></em>; though as professors
        in a Calvinistic university and community, they never ventured to
        apply these principles to the investigation of religious theories as
        to the <span class="tei tei-q">“depraved nature”</span> of the human
        mind. They passed over the whole question in utter silence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Still more
        recently has been developed the system of Phrenology, which is based
        on the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">constitutional diversities</span></em> in mental
        faculties. This system has effectively warred on the theological
        theory of implanted evil propensities, by teaching that every
        faculty, when developed and regulated aright, tends to the best good
        of the race, so that the extinction of any faculty or propensity
        would not be an improvement, but rather an injury to the constitution
        of mind.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the same time,
        by the influence of our schools, our colleges, our pulpits, our
        popular lectures and our wide-spread periodicals, both religious and
        secular, the mind of all classes has been rising to a larger
        development, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page289">[pg
        289]</span><a name="Pg289" id="Pg289" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and
        to clearer and more discriminating views of mental and moral science
        in every department. Thus the people are gradually throwing off the
        chains of ecclesiastical authority and assuming that liberty of
        thought and action, which their Almighty Father designed as the chief
        birth-right of all his intelligent offspring.</p>

        <span style="font-size: 173%">Chapter XLIII. Practical Tendencies of
        the Two Systems.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the preceding
        pages it has been shown that the common-sense system presents an
        intelligible, practical and consistent standard of right and wrong,
        by which we can judge clearly of the character and conduct, both of
        the Creator and of his creatures.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The mind of the
        Creator existing from all eternity, independently of his own will, is
        the pattern of perfectness in the construction of mind. He has formed
        and sustains a system fitted to his own perfections. The chief end of
        this system is happiness-making on the greatest possible scale. In
        order to this, his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">laws</span></em>, by which the most possible
        good with the least possible evil will be secured, must be discovered
        and obeyed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Accordingly, all
        that tends to secure happiness without evil is right, and all that
        needlessly lessens or destroys happiness is wrong. Every effort to
        discover the laws of God and to obey them is right and <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page290">[pg 290]</span><a name="Pg290" id="Pg290"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> pleasing to him as promoting his chief
        desire and great end. This view furnishes a foundation for clear
        conceptions in every practical question of right and wrong. What is
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for the
        best</span></em> as discovered by reason and experience? This is the
        great question, when we have no direct revelation from God. And even
        when revelation intervenes, it must be only in regard to <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">general
        rules</span></em>, leaving it still a matter of experience and
        discussion in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">applying</span></em> these rules to the
        multitudes of varying cases in human experience. Thus, for example, a
        command to be honest toward all, leaves innumerable questions to be
        settled as to what <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">is</span></em> honest and fair in the multiplied
        cases arising between man and man.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But we always have
        the great principle of common sense to guide us, that <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">whatever is for the
        best is right</span></em>, leaving it for reason and experience to
        settle what is and what is not for the best.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But in contrast
        the Augustinian system, in many ways, tends to becloud the mind in
        regard to practical questions of right and wrong.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the
        assumption that there are no principles in the human mind that enable
        us to judge of the character and conduct of God; that we have no
        means of learning what is the object or end for which all things are
        made; that man is so depraved as to be disqualified to know what is
        right and wrong, except as taught by revelations from God; and at the
        same time disqualified to interpret such revelations until
        regenerated, or by the help of a priesthood; all this tends to create
        the feeling of incertitude as to any question of right and wrong,
        while the abuses of priestly interpretations have so often set the
        Bible in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page291">[pg
        291]</span><a name="Pg291" id="Pg291" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        opposition to our moral sense and common sense as greatly to increase
        the evil.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Add to this, the
        assumption that there is no true virtue in any acts of the
        unregenerate, but that all their moral deeds are sin, and only sin,
        and the perplexity is increased as to what is right and what is wrong
        moral action.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, the fact
        that salvation from eternal misery is possible only to those who have
        gained a new <span class="tei tei-q">“nature,”</span> while it is
        often seen that some of those received into churches as having this
        new nature, are not so charitable, amiable, just or honest, as many
        who are not thus admitted, and the mind is still more beclouded as to
        the real nature of right and wrong in practical conduct.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, the manner
        in which this new nature is recognized by those appointed to decide
        who are regenerated and who are not, in order to admit to or exclude
        from churches, still farther increases the difficulty. The questions
        often propounded on such occasions relate mainly to certain states of
        feeling toward God or Christ, or to certain doctrines involved in the
        Augustinian theory. If replies to these are satisfactory, the
        candidate is pronounced regenerated and received to the church.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meantime, ever
        since the days of Luther, the doctrine of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“justification by faith,”</span> in opposition to
        <span class="tei tei-q">“salvation by works,”</span> has been assumed
        to be the foundation principle, both of Protestantism and of true
        piety, while there has been great indistinctness of conception as to
        the true meaning of these terms. At the time of the great conflict
        between Romanism and the Reformers, the grand evil to be combated was
        a reliance <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page292">[pg
        292]</span><a name="Pg292" id="Pg292" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> for
        salvation on the prescribed outward rites and forms of the church
        without any reference to an internal spiritual principle. The attempt
        of the Reformers was to substitute for these outward forms that
        spiritual principle which consists in a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ruling purpose to
        discover and to obey the will of God according to the teachings of
        Christ</span></em>, whom they regarded as <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“God manifest in the flesh.”</span> They recognized the
        fact that no man ever did or ever could live without some violations
        of the laws of God, so that no man could be saved on the ground of
        perfect obedience to law. Instead of this they assumed that man could
        gain eternal life by <span class="tei tei-q">“becoming a new creature
        in Christ Jesus,”</span> meaning by this that <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“new life”</span> which consists in ceasing to live to
        please self, and living to please God in Christ as the chief end of
        life, by earnest conformity to his will as learned either by reason
        and experience or by the Bible.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is what they
        intended by faith in Jesus Christ. And the opposite doctrine of
        <span class="tei tei-q">“salvation by works”</span> was that which
        the Romish church was urging, viz., conformity to her outward rites
        and forms.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But in process of
        time, and for want of clear conceptions and clear teaching, it came
        about that the real good works, commanded by Christ, as a part of the
        love of God required, were confounded with the rites and forms, and
        outward deeds commanded by the church, and which may be performed
        without the principle of love to Christ, which is exhibited in
        obedience to his teachings. The result has been that the teachings
        and writings of many Protestants often make the impression that the
        good works of a pure morality are of no avail and often very
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page293">[pg 293]</span><a name="Pg293"
        id="Pg293" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> much in the way of a man's
        final salvation. Thus has arisen the distinction often made between
        good <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">moral</span></em> men and good <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">religious</span></em>
        men. This classification rests entirely on the Augustinian dogma,
        that until the depraved nature received from Adam is regenerated, all
        the moral acts of men, however virtuous and excellent, are
        <span class="tei tei-q">“sin, and sin only.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The true meaning
        of <span class="tei tei-q">“justification by faith and not by
        works,”</span> is that men are not to be saved by <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actually finding
        out</span></em> in all possible cases what is for the best and then
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">doing</span></em> it, which no man ever did or
        ever can do without mistake; but rather by <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a ruling purpose to
        discover and to obey</span></em> all the laws of the Creator. This
        last is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">spiritual</span></em> principle in opposition to
        mere <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">outward acts</span></em>. It is <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">practical</span></em>
        faith in God which is to save the soul of man. All, therefore, who
        believe Christ to be God are <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“justified”</span> by <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">faith</span></em> in
        Christ. That is, they are regarded and treated as just and righteous,
        when they have this internal principle of obedience to Christ, even
        though they are never free from actual transgression of law, either
        known or unknown. Thus the ancient patriarchs were saved by faith in
        Christ, he being the God of the old dispensation as much as of the
        new.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That this is the
        sense in which the Reformers used the words <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“justification, or salvation by faith,”</span> in
        opposition to <span class="tei tei-q">“salvation by works,”</span>
        may easily be proved. At the same time, it is as easy to show that
        they used this term in another sense also. But at this time no
        reference will be made to any other use than the one under
        consideration. Their other use of this term in reference to the
        atonement of Jesus Christ will be referred to
        hereafter.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page294">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The preceding
        exhibits the several ways in which the Angustinian theory tends to
        becloud the mind in regard to practical questions of right and wrong.
        These tendencies have been more or less counteracted by the implanted
        principles of reason. Still more have they been rectified by the
        steady and clear teachings of the Bible, which never, when truly
        interpreted, contradict either the moral sense or common sense of
        man, but rather strengthen them and guide them aright.</p>

        Systems in the Training of Children.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been shown
        that the common-sense system results from the implanted principles of
        mind, so that no person can be entirely free from its influence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Augustinian
        system has also been shown in its Calvinistic and Arminian
        tendencies.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Calvinistic
        form, making it certain that, owing to the depravity of nature
        consequent on Adam's sin, every moral act is sin and only sin, while
        there is no revealed mode of securing regeneration, leads to hopeless
        inefficiency and neglect of religious advantages. The Arminian form,
        maintaining the efficacy of certain rites and ceremonies in securing
        regeneration, tends to a disastrous dependence on outward
        observances.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Those parents who
        are trained in the Calvinistic school, usually <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">begin</span></em>
        education more or less on the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page295">[pg 295]</span><a name="Pg295" id="Pg295" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> common-sense theory that children can and do
        please God when they are obedient, gentle, kind, self-denying and
        conscientious. Prayers and hymns are also taught to the little ones
        that make this impression.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But when advancing
        years bring the pulpit and other Calvinistic influences to bear,
        these impressions, more or less, fade away, and are followed by the
        depressing feeling that nothing that a child does is either good or
        pleasing to the heavenly Father till the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“wicked heart”</span> is changed by God, and that there
        is no definite, practical mode of securing this change. The
        consequence, in many cases, is, that all prayer and all attention to
        religious instruction ceases, and a desperate course of worldliness
        and departure from all recognition of God ensues. In other cases, the
        natural result of this Augustinian theory is more or less
        counteracted by conscience, common sense and the Bible.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the other hand,
        the Arminian view of the efficacy of rites and means of grace
        sanctioned by God as the mode of securing regeneration, has led to
        great stress on the use of those rites and forms. The Catholic and a
        portion of the Episcopal church, have taught that the rite of baptism
        was the appointed mode of remedying the depravity engendered from
        Adam. And so indispensable was it deemed to the salvation of infants,
        that not only laymen, but women were allowed to administer this rite
        at the approach of death, when no priest could be obtained, lest the
        infant soul should go to endless perdition with the taint of Adam's
        sin unremoved.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There have been
        great dissensions in the Episcopal <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page296">[pg 296]</span><a name="Pg296" id="Pg296" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> church as to the efficacy of baptism. Some have
        taught that regeneration was imparted by this rite. Others have
        taught that this rite secured the implanting of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“a seed,”</span> or some new mysterious principle, which
        if cherished and cultivated by the church, would result in Christian
        character. Those who hold this view, rely chiefly on the training of
        children in the church as the appointed mode of securing their
        salvation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That branch of the
        Arminian school which left the Episcopal church under Wesley and his
        associates, were driven off by the laxity and want of spiritual life
        consequent on these tendencies to reliance on rites and forms. In
        place of this, they urged the doctrine of instantaneous regeneration,
        to be gained by certain means of grace. According to these teachers,
        regeneration consists in the return of God's Spirit to the soul,
        which is withheld in consequence of Adam's sin. The tendency of this
        view was to lessen reliance on educational training and to exalt the
        importance of other means of grace by which regeneration seemed to be
        secured, and to which the Bible, as was claimed, promised
        success.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, in the
        Arminian sects, where the efficacy of rites and forms by a regularly
        ordained and authoritative priesthood has been relinquished,
        educational training has conformed more to the Calvinistic view. As
        eternal salvation depends on securing regeneration, every thing is
        made secondary to those methods by which regeneration is to be
        gained.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Episcopal
        Arminians, therefore, depend more on educating the young aright, and
        have little dependence on revivals, while the Methodist Arminians
        look <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page297">[pg 297]</span><a name=
        "Pg297" id="Pg297" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> less to education and
        more to revivals and other modes of securing religious
        excitement.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the foundation
        difficulty alike of the Calvinists, the Episcopal Arminians and the
        Methodist Arminians, is the assumption that <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">regeneration of a
        ruined nature</span></em> is the thing to be sought, both by children
        and by adults, as the indispensable prerequisite to salvation, and
        that <span class="tei tei-q">“the means of grace”</span> are not for
        the training and development of a perfect nature, but to gain from
        God the cure of a ruined and helpless one.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In contrast to
        this, the common-sense system recognizes all that is practical in any
        of the three methods. It teaches that man's <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em> is
        perfect, and yet that he is utterly helpless without the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">knowledge</span></em>, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">training</span></em>
        and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">motives</span></em>, for which he is dependent
        alike on God and on man. It teaches that this nature can be trained
        to <span class="tei tei-q">“a new life”</span> by educational
        instrumentalities and by a slow and gradual process. At the same time
        it teaches, that when men have lived a worldly life there may be a
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sudden</span></em> change of character by
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">voluntarily</span></em> commencing a life of
        love and obedience to God, in place of a life of unregulated
        self-indulgence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Since the days of
        Pelagius and Augustine, there has never been any large body of
        Christians who have trained children on the common-sense system
        dissevered from the Augustinian theory. This experiment is yet to be
        tried before its full and proper tendency can be truly developed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Unitarian
        sect, who reject the Augustinian dogma, also reject some of the
        fundamental principles of the common-sense system, especially that on
        which the whole system of moral and religious duty and motive
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg 298]</span><a name="Pg298"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is the object
        of what follows to present the evidence that <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
        people</span></em> are rejecting the Augustinian system, while they
        are retaining the system of common sense, as that alone which is
        taught in the Bible.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Preliminary to
        this, a brief statement of the prominent points of these systems,
        where their antagonism is most practical and apparent, will be
        allowed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Augustinian
        system teaches that on account of Adam's sin, man is born with a
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">nature</span></em> so <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">totally
        depraved</span></em>, that he never performs any truly virtuous acts
        till this nature is regenerated; that the true church of God on earth
        consists only of those who are thus regenerated; and that a visible
        church consists of an organization of persons who profess to possess
        a nature that has been re-created, so that they perform truly
        virtuous acts, as the unregenerated never do.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In opposition to
        this, the common-sense system teaches that man is born with a perfect
        nature, so that he can and does act virtuously without any change in
        this nature; also that the true church of God on earth <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page299">[pg 299]</span><a name="Pg299" id="Pg299"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> consists of all those whose chief end and
        earnest purpose is to discover and to obey all his laws; and a
        visible church consists of any who associate by some outward
        organization to aid each other in attempts to discover and to obey
        the laws of God.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The evidence that
        the people are rejecting the former, and assuming the latter view as
        that which is taught in the Bible, will now be presented under these
        heads:</p>

          <span style="font-size: 144%">Present Position of
          Theologians.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In attempting to
          portray the present state of the theological world, it is needful
          first to distinguish between a class which may distinctively be
          termed theologians and the much larger class which are pastors of
          the people.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The two classes
          are so commingled that it would be impossible to draw any line so
          exact as to arrange all in these two classes; for sometimes the
          same person is both theologian and pastor. Still there is
          foundation for classification as distinct as ordinarily exists in
          regard to other professions where men combine diverse pursuits.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In attempting
          this classification, it must be noticed that the religious world is
          divided into great denominations, each having its theological
          schools, its <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page300">[pg
          300]</span><a name="Pg300" id="Pg300" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          colleges, its theological magazines and its religious
          newspapers.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All these are
          conducted by men whose business is not that of pastors, and yet a
          great majority of whom were educated for this office by a regular
          theological training. Meantime, their position, professional
          reputation and daily bread depend on maintaining the particular
          peculiarities in doctrine and practice of a given sect. By this is
          meant, that should they publicly avow a renunciation of the
          peculiarities that distinguish their sect, they would suffer in the
          public estimation of their supporters, and be immediately removed
          from their professional employment. It is this class who are
          usually among the chief leaders of each denomination, and who
          therefore are exposed to all the difficulties and temptations which
          beset those whose power, influence, profession and pecuniary
          support are more or less connected with a <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">conservative</span></em> course in all matters
          of religious opinion—difficulties and dangers to which a pastor is
          much less exposed, so long as he maintains his hold on the
          confidence and affection of his people, who are his chief
          protection against theological persecution of any kind.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first class
          depend on a whole denomination for reputation and a livelihood; the
          last class depend chiefly on their own people. The first class, on
          every practical question, must regard the views and opinions of a
          sect, as leaders and guardians of the interests of a great
          organization, whose very existence depends on the dominance of
          certain opinions. The latter class must chiefly regard the highest
          spiritual good of the souls committed to their care.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, for
          example, the Baptist theological professors, <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page301">[pg 301]</span><a name="Pg301" id="Pg301"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and editors of religious periodicals,
          must maintain that baptism by immersion is the only scriptural mode
          of admission to the visible church of God and to the sacrament, or
          give up their influence, reputation and professional livelihood.
          And they must sustain the organized interests of that sect as its
          most trusted and talented leaders. Moreover, the very existence of
          the sect and of their position as its leaders, depend on the
          maintenance of this tenet, for it is this alone that separates them
          from the Congregational sect.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In like manner,
          the Congregational theological professor and editor must maintain
          that form of church organization or give up his post. And so the
          Presbyterian, Episcopal and Methodist theological professors and
          editors are equally bound.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This
          representation does not necessarily imply any thing invidious. If
          it is regarded as a duty to keep up the sectarian divisions, which,
          as has been shown, all result from the Augustinian dogma, then men
          must be supported to do it by theological schools and periodicals.
          And when men are put into positions for the express purpose of
          sustaining the peculiar views of a sect, it is not honest for them
          to hold these positions after they can no longer conscientiously do
          the work they are hired to perform.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But each pastor
          is the leader of his flock; and their opinions and practices are
          more or less at his control as their religious teacher. And so long
          as he can carry his people with him he is independent of every
          other ecclesiastical power. True, he may be censured, deposed and
          excluded from a given sect or party, but his people only have to
          declare themselves independent, and that they choose to retain him
          as their religious <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page302">[pg
          302]</span><a name="Pg302" id="Pg302" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          teacher, and no one can harm him as to his professional employment
          or his support.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus it is that
          the pastors of churches have fewer of those difficulties to meet
          which restrain the chief theological leaders of a sect.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We are now
          prepared to notice the present position of theologians in this
          country.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been
          shown that the chief theological conflicts, since the days of
          Augustine, and also the chief sects, have resulted from attempts to
          throw off the dogma introduced by him in some one of its
          developments. Thus the conflict headed by Luther was against the
          substitution of external rites and forms resulting from man's
          helpless depravity for an internal principle of love and
          obedience.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The conflict
          commenced by Arminius was to maintain man's ability to do something
          by his own efforts to gain eternal life, in opposition to the utter
          inability taught by Calvinism.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The conflict
          commenced by Wesley and his associates, was to rouse men from a
          resting in outward rites and forms and educational training, by
          making instantaneous regeneration a practicable aim, and one to be
          secured by the use of <span class="tei tei-q">“the means of
          grace.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The conflict
          commenced by President Edwards was to remedy the Calvinistic
          tendency to hopeless inefficiency and waiting for God to
          regenerate, by insisting on man's ability to obey all that God
          requires.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The conflict led
          by the New Haven school of divines, was, in fact, an attempt to cut
          up the Augustinian system by the root, in maintaining that sin
          consists in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">wrong action</span></em> of a right nature,
          and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page303">[pg 303]</span><a name=
          "Pg303" id="Pg303" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> not in a depraved
          nature and its inevitable results.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All these
          controversies have been carried on, more and more, in the audience
          of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
          people</span></em>, who, in the meantime, have been continually
          advancing in mental culture and knowledge.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Especially has
          this been the case in this country, where religion has been freed
          from civil restraints. Several of the religious sects have been so
          divided on these matters as to involve civil suits to settle
          questions of property, thus bringing theologians and lawyers on to
          the same arena. And thus discussions on theological points were
          reported in secular papers.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This was the
          case in the rending of the Presbyterian church into the Old and
          New-school sections. During this controversy, some of the most
          honored and talented of the clergy were suspended from their pulpit
          duties and threatened with dismission from theological
          professorships, solely on the charge of denying certain points of
          doctrine of the Augustinian system. And the highest judicature of
          the nation was called to decide whether the men thus charged had,
          or had not so departed from orthodox creeds as to warrant the loss
          of place and income.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this
          discussion, the endowments of colleges, of theological schools, and
          of church property, were so at stake, that the laymen all over the
          land were obliged to inquire into and understand the merits of a
          discussion strictly metaphysical and theological.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In
          Massachusetts, at one time, the whole State was excited by the
          question whether there were any other <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">churches</span></em> except the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">congregations</span></em> that worshiped
          together <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page304">[pg
          304]</span><a name="Pg304" id="Pg304" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          and supported the minister. This question was argued before the
          highest court of the State, and decided in the negative, while for
          years the controversy was prolonged.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meantime, the
          study of mental science has been introduced into both colleges and
          schools all over the land, and the sons, and even the daughters of
          our farmers and mechanics, have gained clearer and more
          discriminating views on such subjects than can now be found in the
          writings of Aristotle, Plato, and the wisest men of past ages.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Phrenology,
          also, has drawn maps of the mental faculties, so that even the
          senses have been trained to aid in metaphysics.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The pulpit, the
          press and public lecturers now, when they refer to the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">intellect</span></em>, the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=

          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the moral
          powers</span></em>, and use other metaphysical terms, are
          understood by all.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In short, the
          human mind has developed in all directions, until it is impossible
          any longer to conceal absurdities under cover of hard names and
          metaphysical abstrusities, especially when the practical concerns
          of this life, as well as the life to come, are equally
          involved.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meantime, the
          most vigorous and acute minds in the various opposing sects and
          theological schools, have been exhibiting, in magazines and
          newspapers, the difficulties and absurdities each finds in the
          creed and teaching of all who differ, while it is the laymen who
          read and pay for these periodicals. In these, and many other ways,
          the discussions which once were confined to metaphysicians and
          theologians, have come before the people, and the Augustinian
          system has <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page305">[pg
          305]</span><a name="Pg305" id="Pg305" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          been more and more clearly exhibited as contrary to the moral sense
          and common sense of mankind.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few years
          since, Dr. Edward Beecher published the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Conflict of
          Ages</span></span>, in which, with a calm and Christian spirit and
          in a popular form, was set forth the difficulties consequent on the
          Augustinian system, which for ages have agitated all
          Christendom.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this work, it
          is shown that there are <span class="tei tei-q">“principles of
          honor and right”</span> which all theologians agree in maintaining
          that God must and does regard and obey; that these principles are
          violated by God on the supposition that he has brought mankind into
          being in this world with a depraved nature; and finally, that all
          theories as yet invented by theologians to relieve the Creator from
          such an imputation are failures, except the theory, which is there
          presented, of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">a pre-existent state</span></em>, according to
          which, mankind were created with perfect natures, which they ruined
          by sinning, and came into this life to be restored to their former
          perfect state.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Much that
          appears in the early portion of this work is from this source.
          Still more has been gained from that work in the clear manner in
          which it is there proved, that the Bible does not teach that the
          sin of Adam had any effect on <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          nature”</span> of the human race, and that the interpretation given
          to the passage in Romans v., which is the chief one claimed as
          teaching this doctrine, not only has been interpreted wrong, but is
          contrary to the rendering of the whole Christian world from the
          apostles to Augustine.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In other words,
          the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Conflict of Ages</span></span> came before
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
          people</span></em> with the claim, that the Augustinian theory of a
          depraved nature consequent on the sin of Adam, as <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page306">[pg 306]</span><a name="Pg306" id="Pg306"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> taught by all theologians of the great
          Catholic and Protestant sects, is contrary to the moral sense of
          mankind and entirely unsupported by the Bible.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This work was
          read, not only by theologians and pastors, but by intelligent
          laymen, to an extent never known before of a strictly theological
          work.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And what was the
          ground taken by theologians of all schools? They were bound to show
          to the people, in opposition to this work, if they could, that this
          Augustinian dogma <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">was not</span></em> contrary to the moral
          sense of mankind, and that it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">was</span></em> taught in the Bible.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But not a single
          attempt of this kind has ever been made. This universal <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">silence</span></em>
          is as direct a confession of inability to reply as ever was known
          in the theological world. All that ever has been attempted has
          been, to show that the theory of a preëxistent state, offered by
          that author, affords little or no relief, and is without scriptural
          authority.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The words of a
          distinguished theologian and editor of a theological quarterly,
          addressed to the writer, express the case exactly: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Your brother has succeeded in throwing us all into the
          ditch, but he has shown us no way to get out.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That is to say,
          so long as the doctrine of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">depraved nature</span></em> that insures
          <span class="tei tei-q">“sin, and only sin,”</span> in every
          unregenerate mind, is maintained, there is no <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">satisfactory</span></em> way yet devised of
          proving the wisdom and benevolence of God, by the concessions of
          theologians themselves.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the same
          time, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Conflict of Ages</span></span>, in removing
          the chief passage in the Bible relied on for proving that
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in
          consequence of Adam's sin</span></em> the nature of all men has
          become depraved, has equally removed the evidence <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page307">[pg 307]</span><a name="Pg307" id="Pg307"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> most relied on to prove that there is
          any such <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">depravity of nature</span></em> taught in the
          Bible at all.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This universal,
          tacit concession of theologians of all schools, in reference to
          this famous passage of Scripture, had no little influence in
          bringing before the public the volume entitled <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Common Sense Applied
          to Religion, or the Bible and the People</span></span> before
          referred to.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this work,
          the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">principles of common sense</span></em> and the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature or
          construction of mind</span></em> are by the author exhibited more
          at large than in this volume. And the common-sense system of
          religion as thus educed is also set forth, though less completely
          and extensively than in this work.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The laws of
          language and interpretation also are introduced into that work for
          the purpose of showing (in the second volume not yet published)
          that the common-sense system is also taught in the Bible.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But preliminary
          to this, it was seen to be important to apply the principles of
          common sense to prove that the Bible is a collection of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">reliable</span></em> records, of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">reliable</span></em> revelations from the
          Creator to mankind.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was seen
          also, that if the Augustinian system is really taught in these
          writings, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">it is impossible to prove them to be reliable
          revelations</span></em> from God, as is set forth at large in
          chapter 34 of this present volume.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For this reason,
          in the Addenda to the first volume the Augustinian theory is
          introduced, and very briefly shown to be, not only contrary to the
          common sense and moral sense of mankind, but also without support
          from the Bible.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before
          publication, this work was sent to a large number of those regarded
          as among the most acute and profound theologians of the several
          classes described <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page308">[pg
          308]</span><a name="Pg308" id="Pg308" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          herein, with the request that if they detected inaccuracies as to
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">facts</span></em>, or <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fallacious
          reasonings</span></em>, they would point them out for revision. In
          making this appeal it was stated that the writer had little taste
          for metaphysics or theology, and had been driven to them in the
          stress of great sorrow and under a tremendous pressure of motive as
          narrated in the Introduction.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Several of those
          thus addressed, returned criticisms and remarks in reply. The book
          was then issued, in which the author appeared not in the attitude
          of a teacher, but as an inquirer. And the closing inquiries
          were:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Are these
          principles of common sense accepted?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Is <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
          system</span></em> of natural religion evolved by their aid
          accepted?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Is the
          Augustinian theory of depravity, as tried by these principles and
          the rules of interpretation, supported either by reason or the
          Bible?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The work, as
          thus revised, was again sent to these same theologians, and it was
          noticed in most of the periodicals.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The result was
          the same as was accorded to the arguments of the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Conflict of
          Ages</span></span>. Some criticisms on style, language and minor
          matters appeared in the notices of the book, but the above main
          questions thus submitted were met with an ominous <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">silence</span></em>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">None of the
          theologians of any school has pointed out any misstatement of any
          specific fact; nor have they attempted to dispute the principles of
          common sense set forth, or the results of their application in the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">system</span></em> thus evolved. Nor have they
          attempted to show that the passage in the Bible on which
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page309">[pg 309]</span><a name=
          "Pg309" id="Pg309" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the Augustinian
          theory chiefly rests, is sanctioned by the interpretations of the
          apostolic ages, or that the interpretation of it in the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Conflict
          of Ages</span></span>, is incorrect.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Moreover, in the
          columns of the Independent, in reply to their notice of her work,
          the following statement was made by the author:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Finally, on
          consulting one of the most shrewd and best informed publishers in
          regard to the future volume, he expressed the opinion that
          <span class="tei tei-q">“in whatever else theologians differed,
          they were all united in the determination that the investigation
          proposed by the author <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          permitted</span></em>.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This being so,
          the author has concluded, and the public probably will conclude,
          that the most profound and acute theologians of this country have
          relinquished the idea of attempting any farther defense of the
          Augustinian dogma.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The word
        <span class="tei tei-q">“church,”</span> as used in this article,
        refers chiefly to those close corporations which claim to be
        regenerated persons, whose depraved nature, transmitted from Adam,
        has been so far rectified by re-creation, that they are, more or
        less, in the practice of true virtue, of which the unregenerate world
        are supposed to be totally destitute.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this sense they
        claim to be <span class="tei tei-q">“the saints,”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the righteous,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        elect,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“the children of God,”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the salt of the earth,”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the light of the world,”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“a holy nation,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“a
        peculiar people.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While the members
        of these churches do not claim that all who do not come into their
        organizations are <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page315">[pg
        315]</span><a name="Pg315" id="Pg315" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of
        the opposite class, they do, by their profession and admission to
        such churches, claim to be of the regenerated class, to whom the
        above terms of the Bible are to be applied, while the great majority
        of mankind, not in these organizations, are called by them
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the world,”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the unregenerate,”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“sinners,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        wicked,”</span> and by other similar terms.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So long as the
        great body of the people were guided chiefly by ecclesiastics, and
        were thus trained to believe that heaven was to be gained by some
        unintelligible <span class="tei tei-q">“change of nature,”</span>
        imparted by priestly agency, or by some supernatural intervention of
        God's Spirit, these claims were regarded with mystified fear and
        doubt.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the more
        intelligence and discussion have spread among the people, the more
        such claims have been questioned and distrusted.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many things have
        combined to increase such distrust. Among these may be mentioned the
        discussions already noticed, conducted by theologians themselves, by
        which the absurdities and inconsistencies maintained by each, were
        exposed by all the others.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another cause of
        distrust has been the great variety of <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tests</span></em> and
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">signs of
        regeneration</span></em>. One class of religious teachers claim a
        certain kind of experience as indispensable to admission to the
        church. A second class reprobate this sign and set up another. A
        third class depreciate both and insist upon still another. And thus
        it is made apparent, that theologians do not agree among themselves
        what the <span class="tei tei-q">“depraved nature”</span> of man
        consists in, nor what are the true signs or evidence of its
        <span class="tei tei-q">“saving change.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another cause of
        distrust has arisen from attempts <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page316">[pg 316]</span><a name="Pg316" id="Pg316" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> to carry out a system of church discipline.
        Some churches expel persons for interpreting the Bible in a different
        mode from themselves or their creed. Others expel their members for
        vending alcoholic drinks, or for dancing, or for holding slaves, or
        for marrying the sister of a deceased wife. Meantime, the sins of
        pride, anger, covetousness, avarice, worldliness, evil temper,
        unfairness in business, hard dealings with the poor, and many other
        developments of selfishness, often are made no bar to full and
        honorable communion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, in churches
        and sects that are most strenuous in attempting to maintain by church
        discipline a uniformity of interpretation of the Bible conformed to
        their own, it has come to pass that orthodoxy of interpretation is
        sometimes <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">practically</span></em> placed before morality
        of conduct. Thus, if a member of a church or a minister is suspected
        of denying the supreme divinity of Christ, or the depravity and need
        of regeneration of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">nature</span></em> in man, a great agitation is
        produced, and attempts are made, by church discipline, to rectify the
        evil as very dangerous. In the meantime, a slanderous tongue, or
        dishonest dealings, or selfish worldliness, excite less concern, and
        arouse to less effort. The inevitable result is an impression that
        churches and ministers place conformity of interpretation to their
        own creeds or opinions before morality, and consequently the feeling
        is engendered, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">that church organizations, founded on the
        Augustinian theory, tend to immorality</span></em>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This impression as
        to the immoral tendency of such church organizations, has been
        increased by the fact that in times of special religious excitement,
        that class of men in many cases, become most prominent as leaders
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page317">[pg 317]</span><a name="Pg317"
        id="Pg317" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in prayer meetings and other
        public ministries whose character for consistency in private life, or
        in business matters, is low. It is perceived that this fact does not
        prevent these men from being regarded as religious men, and as
        superior to others, who, living exemplary lives, are unable or
        unwilling to take any conspicuous place in religious movements. And
        when the period of excitement is passed, it is found that these
        leaders in revival seasons are no better in their private life and
        business dealings than before.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is also
        sometimes the case that men of high character and position, can not
        be reached by church discipline as are the humbler members, and thus
        sin is made respectable by its association at once with talents,
        influence, wealth and church membership.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In addition to
        this, the fact that so many ministers and churches have taken such an
        antagonistic course in the public movements to remove intemperance
        and slavery from our land, has led to open attacks on ministers and
        churches in the newspapers, in public lectures and in many other
        ways, in which their inconsistencies have been held up to public
        ridicule as well as to more serious denunciation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So long as the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“change of nature,”</span> which fits man for
        heaven, was regarded as a supernatural mystery which no one could
        understand or explain, while the approved signs of regeneration were
        submitted only to ministers, deacons, elders and church committees,
        the matter was exclusively in their keeping.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But as soon as the
        nature of regeneration began to be explained intelligibly, and men
        adopted the common-sense view, that the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">true</span></em>
        church consists of persons who not only believe in Christ
        intellectually, but <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page318">[pg
        318]</span><a name="Pg318" id="Pg318" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        believe <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">practically</span></em>, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
        that they are those who <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">obey</span></em> Christ, the case bore a
        different aspect. <span class="tei tei-q">“These are the
        persons,”</span> they say, <span class="tei tei-q">“who organize on
        the assumption that they are regenerated because they obey Christ's
        teachings, while so many virtuous persons are shut out as <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">totally</span></em>
        and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">entirely</span></em> disobedient,—as never
        feeling or acting truly virtuously in the sight of God in a single
        instance!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The more this
        questionable assumption has become apparent, the more has been the
        disturbing influence on both the church and the world.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Multitudes of
        serious, virtuous and conscientious persons, who are really living
        Christian lives and making it their chief concern to obey the great
        Master, have refused to join associations that make such dubious
        claims.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Still more has
        been the revulsion from those churches which demand as terms to
        admission professed belief in certain modes of interpreting the Bible
        contained in a creed. They, holding the Protestant doctrine that
        every man is to interpret the Bible for himself, responsible to no
        man or body of men, can not thus resign their religious liberty.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meantime, the
        Christian profession has ceased to be a cross in any way, and has
        rather become honorable. Those who have been taught that a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">purpose</span></em>
        or determination to obey Christ was regeneration, have in many cases
        formed such a purpose, confessed belief in the needful creeds and
        joined the church in great numbers, before they had time to ascertain
        whether they had moral strength to carry out this purpose. They find
        on trial that they have not, and then discover that though there is
        an open door to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">enter</span></em> the church <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page319">[pg 319]</span><a name="Pg319" id="Pg319"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> there is none for exit that is not
        discreditable, and so they remain.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Others come into
        the church for worse motives, to secure the confidence, respect and
        trust that is accorded to that profession. Thus it has come to pass
        that the class, denominated <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        world,”</span> has been growing in Christian character and practical
        virtue, while, as a body, <span class="tei tei-q">“the church”</span>
        has been deteriorating.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The writer, in her
        very extensive travels and intercourse with the religious world, has
        had unusual opportunities to notice how surely and how extensively
        the conviction of this fact has been pressed on the minds of the best
        class of Christian ministers and laymen. More than twenty years ago,
        one of the most laborious Episcopal bishops of the western States, in
        reply to inquiries as to the state of religion in his large diocese
        replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“the world is growing better and the
        church is growing worse.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">More than ten
        years ago, a distinguished lawyer, who had extensive financial
        business to transact, himself an honored and exemplary member of the
        church, stated to the writer that he was decided in the conviction
        that the better class of worldly men were more honorable and reliable
        in business matters than the majority of church members. When asked
        to account for this, the reply was that religious men were chiefly
        interested to get to heaven, which in their view was to be secured
        <span class="tei tei-q">“by faith and not by works,”</span> and so
        good works became a secondary concern. But the chief concern of
        worldly men is to succeed in this life, and they have learned that
        honesty is the best policy in attaining their chief end.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This statement was
        repeated to another exemplary <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page320">[pg 320]</span><a name="Pg320" id="Pg320" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> church member, who, as a bank officer and
        lawyer of distinguished integrity, was said to transact more business
        than any other man in the north-western States. He remarked that the
        above was exactly his own opinion, and, moreover, he stated that a
        friend of his, also a church member, who, he said, did more business
        than any other man in Central New York, had expressed to him the same
        opinion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These statements
        were repeated not long ago to a business man, an exemplary member of
        an orthodox church in Boston, and he expressed the same opinion. In
        repeated other instances that need not be enumerated, in various
        sections of the country, the same opinion has been expressed by
        intelligent and consistent members of the church, whose prejudices
        would naturally lead them to the most favorable view of the case.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such impressions
        have not been decreased by the recent multiplied defalcations,
        forgeries, and other business dishonesties that have occurred in the
        last three years among church members and officers of religious
        charities in high places of trust.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To all this add
        the fact, that a large class of men of exemplary private life, who
        are spending their time, money and influence for the relief of human
        woes and the redress of social and political wrongs, are at the same
        time openly attacking the church as the chief bulwark of these
        wrongs, while all the delinquencies of ministers and churches are
        freely discussed and denounced by them <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">before the
        people</span></em>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The result is,
        that a large portion of the most exemplary and intelligent part of
        the church feel themselves to be in a dubious and false position, and
        are <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page321">[pg 321]</span><a name=
        "Pg321" id="Pg321" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> daily querying whether
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">professing</span></em> to be a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">peculiar</span></em>
        people is not doing more harm than good; and whether it would not be
        better that the influence of good men should rest on their <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">unassociated</span></em> individual character,
        and not on organizations making such high profession where the light
        of goodness is obscured by associated darkness.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Great doubt and
        skepticism, both in the church and out of it, have thus arisen also
        as to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">what
        real religion consists in</span></em>, and as to what <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">are</span></em> the
        true claims of the church and its ministry.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Multitudes who
        would enter the church if it was regarded simply as an association of
        persons to support the ordinances appointed by Jesus Christ, and to
        aid each other in obeying his Word, turn from its present position
        and claims with distrust or disgust. At the same time ministers and
        church members, feeling these difficulties, have more and more
        relinquished the Augustinian theory as the basis of their
        organization, and are advancing to an open avowal of the common-sense
        ground, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, that the real invisible
        church of Christ embraces all those who acknowledge him as their Lord
        and Master, and make it their chief aim to understand and to obey his
        teachings, and that a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">visible church</span></em> is any association of
        persons who organize to aid each other in this object, by sustaining
        a ministry and worship as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">they</span></em> understand to be most in
        agreement with the teachings of Christ.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Episcopal
        church, both in Great Britain and in this country, although as
        strictly Augustinian in its articles as any other, has taken the lead
        of all others in practically renouncing that system. Any man can more
        readily secure all the privileges of membership <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page322">[pg 322]</span><a name="Pg322" id="Pg322"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in that church without any confession of
        faith or public profession of a <span class="tei tei-q">“change of
        nature,”</span> than in any of the other Augustinian denominations,
        and this is probably one great reason of its prosperity in this
        country.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Any sensible man
        of good moral character, who should state in a respectful and candid
        spirit, that he could not conscientiously submit to acknowledging in
        any form, the rights of any man or body of men to decide for him in
        regard to the interpretation of the Bible; that according to his
        understanding of its teachings, he was bound to acknowledge Jesus
        Christ as his Lord and Master in all matters of faith and practice,
        and to associate himself with other avowed followers of Christ by
        some form of open acknowledgment; that as he understands the New
        Testament, the rites of baptism and the Lord's Supper were instituted
        as forms of such acknowledgment and communion, and that he wished
        thus to connect himself with the Episcopal church without any creed,
        confession or acknowledgment; it is believed, that in such a case,
        there are few ministers and still fewer laymen who would not think it
        right to gratify such a desire. It is believed that there are many,
        also, of the highest standing for intellect, piety and position in
        the Presbyterian, Baptist, Methodist and Congregational churches, who
        have so far thrown aside the system of Augustine, that they also
        would receive such a man to their communion on these terms.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this state of
        feeling among laymen the developments of sectarianism, which, as has
        been shown, all relate to matters of rites and forms, resulting from
        the Augustinian theory, have become more and more suspicious and
        offensive. Especially is this the case <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page323">[pg 323]</span><a name="Pg323" id="Pg323" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> in the newer States, where union and harmony
        among good men are most needed.</p>

        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Common
        Sense Applied to Religion</span></span>, page 342, statistics are
        introduced from the reports of three of the largest sects of this
        country, the Old and New school Presbyterian and the Congregational
        churches, showing that, owing to their sectarian divisions,
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nearly one
        third</span></em> of their churches are without ministers, and
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nearly one
        half</span></em> of these churches have not over fifty members, the
        majority of these being women, while the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">relative</span></em>
        amount of ministers to churches is constantly decreasing. Not only in
        the large, but the smaller towns, the struggle to build churches and
        support ministers among the various sects, that differ only as to
        rites and forms, is most mournful, making a taxation both on the East
        and West for their support which is incredible.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each denomination
        is trained to regard itself as <span class="tei tei-q">“the church of
        God”</span> and to labor for its increase as a service to God's
        cause, while the extension of other sects is not so regarded.
        Although few intelligent Protestants now believe that any forms or
        rites are indispensable to salvation, each sect regards its own
        peculiarity as of very great importance. And as all the large sects
        are divided only on modes of baptism or of church organization there
        is a constant tendency to magnify these points of difference. Were it
        not for this, in small places and in new settlements, all would unite
        in one large, harmonious church, that could not only support its own
        ordinances, but send of its surplus to supply the destitute. Instead
        of this, the feuds, envies, jealousies and bickerings between small
        and struggling churches, of from four to twenty diverse <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page324">[pg 324]</span><a name="Pg324" id="Pg324"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> sects, are an occasion of reproach and
        contempt to the world, and of mortification to all honorable and
        pious minds.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So in regard to
        education, each sect is now acting <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as a
        sect</span></em>, in starting new colleges and seminaries, or in
        endowing those already started, and this often with little reference
        to the supply provided by other sects. For example, in Ohio there are
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">twenty-six</span></em> endowed colleges, in
        Indiana there are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">eleven</span></em>, and thus at the same rate in
        other new States.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Besides endowments
        to support professors, vast sums have been spent in buildings, many
        of them unused for want of pupils. After each sect has thus gained
        its colleges, it must struggle to find pupils, and thus multitudes of
        young boys are pressed into a Latin and Greek course, not at all
        demanded in their future pursuits, and often forsaken before the
        college is ever reached. The waste of educational benefactions in
        these ways is enormous.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These expenditures
        are all to be met by the laity, and the more the nature of these
        sectarian divisions is understood, the more distrustful are the
        people in regard to these profuse expenditures to keep up such
        divisions. Multitudes of intelligent laymen contribute simply because
        their clergymen urge it, and entirely without intelligent approval of
        these things. To their own view, Christianity, as exhibited by
        contending sects, is a source of more evil feeling, contention and
        needless expense than of compensating benefits, and distrust and
        misgiving increase and abound.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In such a position
        of the organized church, one of the most remarkable indications to be
        noted is the occurrence of a <span class="tei tei-q">“revival”</span>
        among all sects, in which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">the</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page325">[pg 325]</span><a name="Pg325" id="Pg325" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a><span style=
        "font-style: italic">people</span></em> take the lead, and
        theologians and pastors willingly resign their wonted place. All
        badges of sect are dropped, and the dogmas of Augustine, from which
        they originated, are thrown aside. The system of common sense is
        recognized, and its intelligent and harmonizing influence secures,
        for the first time, the respectful attention of worldly men toward
        religious developments, which in all past time have been regarded by
        them with suspicion or scorn.</p>

        Churches.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That portion of
        the clerical world who, as pastors, are most nearly in connection
        with the people, are necessarily affected with the influences that
        touch theologians, and also with the condition of their people.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They find that
        what they have been trained to regard as a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">fundamental</span></em> doctrine of the Bible,
        has ceased to be defended by those who have been their teachers in
        theology, and who are the leaders of their sect.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They find their
        own minds very greatly in doubt as to many points taught them in
        their theological training. They find intelligent laymen refusing to
        enter the church, whom they feel to be as really followers of Christ
        in heart and life as any in their churches, while they see many
        professors of religion as selfish, worldly and unprincipled as most
        of the world around, and yet they can not exclude them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They find
        intelligent young men coming to them expressing a desire to obey
        Christ and to unite with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page326">[pg
        326]</span><a name="Pg326" id="Pg326" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> his
        followers in efforts to <span class="tei tei-q">“be good and to do
        good,”</span> but unable to subscribe to the creed of the church in
        regard to a depraved nature and associated tenets, while by one
        expedient or another these pastors waive the difficulty and receive
        them into their churches. They find intelligent mothers and
        Sunday-school teachers throwing aside the Augustinian dogma, and
        training their little ones to believe that they can love and serve
        their Saviour with their present nature and faculties, and that every
        attempt to conform to the rules of duty is well-pleasing to God, and
        a step forward in the path to heaven.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They find
        intelligent Christian mothers wishing to bring their children to the
        communion with no other profession than that they desire and intend
        to obey their Saviour in all things.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this state of
        things, some of the most successful and intelligent pastors have
        decided, in such cases, to cut loose from their creeds and
        confessions, and to receive to the communion any young children whom
        their parents believe and feel to be thus prepared for it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The position
        assumed by the parochial clergy in the great revival of the past
        year, has been a remarkable index.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">The
        people</span></em> of all sects and creeds came together to express
        their wish and intention to serve the Lord Christ by obedience to his
        word in heart and life, and their pastors sat with them as equals in
        all respects before the common Father. They related their experience;
        they exhorted each other to persevere; they united in prayers for
        help and guidance, and their pastors ceased to urge attention to
        those <span class="tei tei-q">“doctrines”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page327">[pg 327]</span><a name="Pg327" id="Pg327"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> founded on the Augustinian theory, which
        in former revivals were made so prominent.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are
        incidents that have come under the personal observation of the writer
        the past year in regard to the parochial clergy which are very
        ominous on account of the character of the persons involved, who not
        only are among the first in intelligence and influence, but may
        properly be denominated, in reference to the leading class of
        pastors, <span class="tei tei-q">“representative men.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In one case, a
        young man of great intelligence and moral worth, who might properly
        be regarded as a <span class="tei tei-q">“representative man”</span>
        of the better portion of <span class="tei tei-q">“Young
        America,”</span> informed the writer that he and his wife had
        accepted the general invitation of their pastor to receive the
        communion. Inasmuch as the doctrines of the creed of that church were
        not accepted by him, the inquiry was made whether this step was taken
        with the approval of his pastor, and the reply was in the
        affirmative.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The inquiry was
        then made, on what ground he united in this ordinance. The reply was,
        substantially, that he wished to be good and to do good, guided by
        the teachings of Christ; that he wished to be united in feeling and
        action with good men, who cherish the same aims, and also to make it
        manifest that he was associated with that class; that he regarded
        this sacramental ordinance as instituted for this very purpose, while
        his minister, as a consistent Protestant, did not insist that he
        should interpret the Bible according to his creed or be shut out from
        this privilege.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In another case,
        an intelligent mother who had trained her children exclusively on the
        common-sense <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page328">[pg
        328]</span><a name="Pg328" id="Pg328" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        theory, informed the writer that she had taken them to the Lord's
        Table with the consent of one of the most distinguished pastors of
        the land, without any examination or admission to the church. She
        simply narrated to him her own opinion that her children from early
        years had learned to love the Saviour and to be conscientious in
        daily efforts to obey his teachings; that they and she felt that they
        were commanded by their Saviour openly to acknowledge themselves as
        his followers, <span class="tei tei-q">“even to the death,”</span> if
        need be, in order to fulfill all righteousness, and that they did not
        and could not believe the creed of that church, nor in the right of
        any man, or body of men, to exact such belief under penalty of
        exclusion from the table of their Lord.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The pastor
        welcomed these lambs of the fold with their mother, and felt that had
        he driven them away it would have been in defiance to their Saviour's
        word, <span class="tei tei-q">“Suffer the little children to come
        unto me, and forbid them not.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In still another
        case, one of the most honored Congregational pastors of New England
        openly declared to friends of the writer that it was in vain to try
        to preach this Augustinian system any longer; that <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the people would not
        hear it</span></em>, and that he should have to preach to bare walls
        if he attempted it any more.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many other similar
        incidents that have come to the knowledge of the writer in different
        quarters of the country, might be added, but the above will suffice
        as illustrative indications of the present position of pastors.</p>

        Education.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is a
        significant fact in regard to the religious training of the young in
        this country, that the most influential leaders of popular education,
        especially in its earlier stages of improvement, have been laymen,
        and laymen who reject the Augustinian dogma, and all organizations
        founded on it. And yet they are men who believe in, and have
        exhibited by their example, the great duty of love to God and love to
        man, in a life of obedience to the physical, social and moral laws of
        God.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meantime, the laws
        of the land which forbid any exclusive favor to any religious sect,
        do, in fact, forbid any religious training in common schools that
        conflicts with the common-sense system. It has been shown (chapter
        39) that the larger Christian sects are all founded, in their
        distinctive features, on the Augustinian dogma. This being so, the
        law that excludes distinctive sectarian teaching excludes the
        Augustinian system.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In regard to
        smaller sects, not Augustinian, the distinctive doctrine of the
        Unitarian creed is such a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">unity</span></em> in regard to the Creator as
        forbids the idea of more than one divine person who has all the
        attributes of God. This, it has been shown in chapter 18, is contrary
        to the common-sense system.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The distinctive
        doctrine of the Universalist creed forbids the idea of the
        perpetuated existence of sinful and miserable beings; this, also, is
        contrary to the common-sense system, as shown in chapter 28. Thus
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page330">[pg 330]</span><a name="Pg330"
        id="Pg330" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the chief sects that are not
        counted as Augustinian or Evangelical, are also excluded from
        introducing their distinctive tenets into the common schools of the
        people.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Moreover, while
        the people, in the schools under their control, thus forbid by law
        any religious training which conflicts with the common-sense system,
        they permit prayers to God and the use of the Bible, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">provided</span></em>
        the privilege is not used, in opposition to the spirit of the above
        law, to introduce distinctive sectarian tenets.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is also very
        noticable that in Great Britain the most influential patrons of
        popular education, and writers on the training of the young, have,
        though members of the established church, vigorously opposed the
        Augustinian system. Archbishop Whateley has written a most powerful
        argument, and one which none have attempted to answer, in favor of
        the common-sense view of church organization. He also has given all
        his influence to the establishment of schools for the people, in
        which every parent and child shall, as far as possible, be <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">free</span></em> in
        regard to religious matters.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The beloved and
        honored name of Arnold, dear to every liberal educator of every sect
        and name, has set the example of a religious training that is based
        entirely on the common-sense system. And probably there is not a man
        living or dead whose influence has been so extensive in guiding
        public opinion on this subject. Without openly denying the articles,
        or forsaking the established church, Whateley, Arnold and their
        associates have warred on the Augustinian theory and its offsets more
        energetically and effectively than any two men that can be named.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, it appears,
        that the people themselves, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page331">[pg 331]</span><a name="Pg331" id="Pg331" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the chief leaders in popular education, have
        decided that no teaching that conflicts with the system of
        common-sense shall be introduced into the common schools.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the most
        important indices of religious change is the advance in the character
        of female education during the last thirty years.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Fifty years ago,
        to read, write and cipher, and a few accomplishments, were all that
        were attempted in the school education of women. A little history and
        one or two other branches were added in some of the higher
        schools.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It being assumed
        that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> the
        faculties, so as to insure a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">well-balanced</span></em> mind, is the chief aim
        of all education, it is probable that the mental culture of women in
        this country for the last thirty years has approached nearer to the
        true standard than was ever known in the experience of any other
        nation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The training to
        the handicraft of the needle, even if only for ornament, the measure
        of domestic duty that most young girls learn to perform, the culture
        of the musical taste and the art of drawing, the combination in
        female schools of mathematics, languages and general knowledge, and
        the immense variety of culture from lectures and general reading, all
        have <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page332">[pg 332]</span><a name=
        "Pg332" id="Pg332" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> tended to develop the
        female mind on a scale of advancement and equable culture never
        before known.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The result is a
        generation of women well trained for high and independent thought and
        action. At the same time, it is probable that there never before was
        so large a proportion of the best educated women who were so
        decidedly conscientious and religious.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is granted by
        all, that it is to woman more than to man, that is committed the
        chief business of training the human mind at its most important stage
        of development. It is granted, also, that in order to success in
        culture, both physical and mental, it is the first step to understand
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
        nature</span></em> of that which is to be trained and developed. The
        first question, then, to every woman, in reference to her first duty
        is, what is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">the nature</span></em> of the minds given us to
        train?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this light, it
        is as if a gardener were to receive some rare and delicate plant with
        directions from his lord to train it with the utmost care; his first
        inquiry would be, What is its nature? Does it require sun or shade?
        Does it need a moist or a sandy soil? Is it a climber, or a shrub, or
        a tree? Or, it is as if a young machinist should receive from his
        master a collection of wheels and springs, and a great variety of
        delicate machinery, with the direction to put them together and
        adjust them for right action. His first inquiry would be, what is the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The preceding
        pages exhibit the kind of replies that for ages have met these
        heart-wrenching queries of womanhood. From most, it is shown, she
        hears that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ruined nature</span></em> of her offspring is
        such that she can do absolutely nothing to secure any right
        development. Others tell her that no one knows what was the end or
        purpose for which the mind of her child was made. Others tell her
        that no one knows what are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">right</span></em> means in regard to the
        training and action of mind. Others tell her that the mind of her
        child is constructed wrong, and that nothing can be done to secure
        its right training and development, but in some way to induce its
        Maker to re-create it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meantime, also,
        her teachers are in conflict as to what is the difficulty with the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">nature</span></em> of her child, and what would
        be its right action, and what is to be done to secure its right
        development. At the same time, the greater portion of the teachings
        on this great matter are so enveloped in abstruse theological and
        metaphysical technics as to baffle the wisest in their attempts to
        gain clear and definite ideas from them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this state of
        the case many sensible mothers and teachers, all over the land, have
        adopted a course dictated by their own common sense and their
        experience of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">nature</span></em> of mind, as discovered in
        their attempts to train it. In pursuing such a course, many of them
        have taught simply the system of common sense, leaving out entirely
        the Augustinian contradictions. They <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page334">[pg 334]</span><a name="Pg334" id="Pg334" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> have in various forms of language taught their
        little ones after this fashion: <span class="tei tei-q">“Your
        heavenly Father made you to be happy and to make others happy. In
        order to this, he wishes that you should always have what you like
        best, except when it would injure you or others. But when what you
        like best and want the most, is not <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">best</span></em> for
        you or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">best</span></em> for others, you must always
        choose what is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">for the best</span></em>, and in so doing you
        act virtuously and please and obey God. And just so far as you do all
        that is best for yourself and for others, guided by the teachings of
        Christ, and with the desire and purpose to obey him, you become a
        virtuous, pious and holy child, and a true Christian.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In taking such a
        course as this, many mothers and teachers find themselves in
        antagonism with the teachings of the pulpit, the Sunday School and
        the great body of religious books, and yet they persevere. And
        sometimes they take their children from the Sunday School because the
        home training is there so directly assailed. And they would, in some
        cases, keep them from the church also, were not the theological
        technics so effective in protecting childhood from all comprehension
        of a large portion of pulpit teachings.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is such
        intelligent, cultivated and pious mothers and teachers that go to
        their pastors with their perplexities and troubles, and not
        unfrequently find that tender sympathy which those only can give who
        have suffered the same kind of distress.</p>

        America.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By the term
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Young America,”</span> as it is used at this
        day, seems to be intended that class of youthful minds who are
        striving to free themselves from all past ecclesiastical and
        conventional restraints, and who are aiming to think and act with
        entire freedom on all subjects.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The most active
        and efficient of this class are those who by general reading and
        study have both strengthened their reasoning powers and been most
        affected by the causes before described, which have tended to lessen
        respect for the church founded on the Augustinian theory of such a
        depraved nature transmitted from Adam, that all unregenerate doings
        are <span class="tei tei-q">“sin, and only sin.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These young minds
        find the power of the pulpit, the church, the religious press, and
        the religious training of the family, the school and the college all
        combined to enforce this doctrine. They feel galled and indignant at
        the chains which they find around them; and trained to interpret the
        Bible as teaching this doctrine and the system based on it, they
        secretly revolt from the authority of that book. They feel that the
        ministers and churches which sustain this doctrine are the grand
        impediments to freedom of thought and opinion, and the chief fortress
        of a system which to them is hateful in theory, and, in their view,
        destructive alike to a true manhood and a pure morality.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But if they speak
        out their feelings they will be denounced <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page336">[pg 336]</span><a name="Pg336" id="Pg336" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> as infidels and avoided as dangerous persons.
        What is more trying still, the mother they love so much will be
        distressed, their father will be equally grieved and perhaps offended
        with their self-conceit, and all their Christian friends will be
        disturbed and displeased.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Under these
        conflicting influences there exists a constant conflict between their
        honest convictions and desire for truth and independent action, and
        their gentle and generous impulses. This is the condition of
        multitudes of young minds, who to please a mother, a father, a sister
        or a friend, attend church and listen in silence to much that they do
        not believe and to some things which they abhor. Others quietly
        withdraw from all religious ministries, on the plea that Sunday is
        more profitably spent by them in quiet strolls or reading at home,
        while the real trouble, secretly burning in their hearts, is scarcely
        breathed aloud.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of this class of
        minds not a few are found in our theological seminaries. And here
        they encounter new difficulties. As the system of Augustinianism is
        developed as the basis of their professional training, they attempt
        to meet it with some discussion. In this they find little or no
        encouragement. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Free discussion</span></em> seems to be deemed
        inadmissible, and those who urge it find themselves in an
        uncomfortable minority, who are regarded rather as agitators than as
        manly and independent seekers after truth.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the most
        powerful influence on the most influential class of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Young America,”</span> as highest in intellectual and
        moral development, has been the practical working of <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two false
        principles</span></em>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first of these
        is, that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">organizations</span></em> to promote
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page337">[pg 337]</span><a name="Pg337"
        id="Pg337" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> truth and righteousness are of
        more consequence than truth and righteousness. Thus, to a Catholic,
        the reputation and interests of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">the church</span></em>—that is, the clergy—are
        to be regarded first, so that its pope and priesthood are to be
        shielded from the public exposure of whatever crimes they may commit,
        lest the influence of the church should suffer. Thus, in Protestant
        ecclesiastical organizations, the sins of their chief leaders are
        sometimes covered and palliated, lest their church and order be
        discredited. Thus the college faculty are sometimes sustained by
        parents or the public in unjust proceedings, lest the respect and
        confidence of the pupils or the public toward them should be
        impaired. Thus, also, the officers of benevolent associations are
        tolerated and shielded from odium for conduct that should receive
        universal disapprobation. In such cases, the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">end</span></em> is
        made secondary to the means—the instrumentalities to promote virtue
        receive more regard than virtue itself. This, among <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“fishers of men,”</span> is making taking the fish
        secondary to the care of the net.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The other false
        principle is, that men are to be restrained from protesting against
        wrong, in cases where it would make great trouble and difficulty to
        individuals or to communities involved in it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That men are to
        use discretion and consult expediency as to the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">time</span></em> and
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">manner</span></em> of exposing and denouncing
        wrong, is one of the teachings of common sense. But that men are to
        protest against wrong only when it makes little or no trouble to any
        one, and be silent when contention and trouble would result from such
        protesting, is a principle that would have inhibited the spread of
        Christianity by the apostles, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page338">[pg 338]</span><a name="Pg338" id="Pg338" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> of the Reformation by Luther, and of every
        other great reform.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The extent to
        which wise and good men have adopted and acted on these false
        principles has probably done more to undermine faith in the Bible and
        the church than all other causes united.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The tendency has
        been to generate the feeling that the great organizations based on
        the Bible and aiming to extend its authority, are really little
        better than associations to sustain the power and the influence of a
        certain privileged class, at the sacrifice of not only truth and
        righteousness, but of manly freedom of thought and speech.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The extent of real
        infidelity, not only in our colleges, but among the young mechanics
        of our shops and manufactories, the young farmers in our fields, the
        clerks in our offices and stores, and Young America all over the
        nation, is little imagined by those, who, on the field of
        conservatism, are striving to repress free discussion. There are
        seething and glowing fires gathering for vent, which such attempts
        are as vain to restrain as are bands of cobwebs to confine an
        outbursting volcano.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In speaking thus
        confidently of the present position of woman and of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Young America,”</span> it seems proper to notice the
        opportunities that have been furnished to attain some knowledge in
        this direction.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During twelve
        years of service as principal of institutions at the East and West,
        in which nearly a thousand young girls from the most influential
        classes and from nearly every State in the Union have been under her
        training, the writer gained no little insight into the varied
        experiences of the young. Later in life, ill health and other causes
        led to frequent reunions with <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page339">[pg 339]</span><a name="Pg339" id="Pg339" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> former pupils all over the land, who as
        mothers, wives and sisters sought sympathy and counsel. Thus was
        gained the private history and the personal acquaintance of their
        husbands, brothers and sons, in many professions and in various
        colleges.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In many cases the
        sons would disclose to a candid and sympathizing friend mental
        experiences and histories of themselves and their companions, which,
        from motives of tenderness, were hidden even from the most kind and
        judicious parents. The affiliated societies that bring the most
        influential young men of different colleges together, their meetings
        for anniversary and club reunions, have generated a common pulse, as
        it were, through the great body of the most highly educated and most
        influential young men in the land; so that learning what affects a
        small portion teaches also what affects the whole.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These intimations

        Religious Press.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To any one who
        examines the religious press of the different sects of the present
        time, it is clear that there never was a period in which the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ecclesiasticism</span></em> founded on the
        Augustinian theory was more a leading object of effort. At the time
        that the Bible Society and other benevolent religious associations
        originated, the tendency <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page340">[pg
        340]</span><a name="Pg340" id="Pg340" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of
        the different sects was to a harmonious union for the great end of
        sending the gospel to the destitute. At that time, questions in
        relation to the modes of ordination and baptism, and as to church
        officers, seemed to vanish as matters of small concern to all whose
        chief aim was to save the lost. But now the reverse tendency is
        manifest. Every sect is engaged in magnifying the importance of its
        own distinctive peculiarity, in getting up publishing houses to
        disseminate its own peculiar modes of religious teaching, in raising
        funds to build churches, and in building up its own distinctive
        schools and colleges. And this is done not so much, as it would seem,
        because the salvation of ignorant and guilty men depends on these
        sectarian peculiarities, as because the extent, respectability and
        influence of a sect will be thus promoted. Every editor of every
        religious paper, therefore, is a chief leader in an effort to build
        up a sect, which as before shown, originates from the Augustinian
        dogma.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is an
        established maxim in law and all administration of justice, that
        where a man's property, character, and professional success are
        involved, he is barred from testimony as an incompetent witness. And
        it is deemed no disparagement to the most honorable and high-minded
        men in the community to be dealt with on the assumption that such
        personal interests so bias men's judgment that they can not be
        trusted.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now it will not be
        denied by any one, that our religious periodicals are all supported
        by the differing sects with the express understanding that each shall
        advocate the views of the sect that especially patronizes it. And
        should any editor become convinced that <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page341">[pg 341]</span><a name="Pg341" id="Pg341" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the opinions he was appointed to advocate are
        false, he could not honorably retain his office without declaring his
        change of opinion, and this declaration would inevitably result in
        the loss of his professional character and income among his friends
        and supporters.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For example, if
        the editor of the Independent were to become convinced that churches
        organized on the Congregational mode were unscriptural, and should
        attempt to defend such a view, he would either resign his post or be
        removed from it. The same would be true in regard to the editors of
        the Presbyterian, Episcopal, Baptist and Methodist religious
        magazines and newspapers.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So in regard to
        the professors of our theological schools, who are the chief
        supporters of theological magazines. They must all teach the
        Augustinian dogma of a depraved nature transmitted from Adam to all
        his descendants, or resign their professional reputation, their
        office and its income.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These being facts,
        it may properly be affirmed that the religious press in this country
        is barred from the full and free discussion of the great question of
        eternal life, <span class="tei tei-q">“What must we do to be
        saved?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the most
        remarkable indications of this fact is the course pursued by the
        leading religious periodicals of each sect in noticing the work
        before referred to, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Common Sense applied to Religion, or the Bible
        and the People</span></span>. In that work, and in an article in the
        Independent, as well as by private letters, an appeal was made to
        their editors, who, many of them, are personal friends of the writer,
        to instruct her and to instruct the public wherein there was any
        failure in that work, either in setting forth truly the principles of
        common <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page342">[pg 342]</span><a name=
        "Pg342" id="Pg342" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> sense and the rules of
        interpretation, or in deducing by these principles the <em class=

        common sense, or in proving that the Augustinian dogma and the system
        founded on it were contrary to the common sense and the moral sense
        of mankind, and unsupported by the Bible.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As these editors
        are not only honorable and Christian gentlemen, but among the most
        acute and profound metaphysicians in the world, it would be the
        height of ill manners to assume that, discerning any failures, they
        refused to specify them, either in private or in public, except for
        the reasons intimated. No editor whose periodical is supported by a
        sect for the express purpose of maintaining its distinctive
        peculiarities, could indorse that work as correct in its statements
        and arguments without giving up the basis on which the existence of
        that sect depends which supports his periodical.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In these
        circumstances the editors of the Independent fairly and openly avowed
        that they could not open their columns to <span class="tei tei-q">“a
        psychological and theological discussion”</span> of this sort. And
        every editor of every other religious periodical tacitly made the
        same declaration by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">entire silence</span></em> on the main subject
        of the volume—the very principles, involving the existence of the
        sect for whose defense they were appointed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So manifest was
        this position of these leaders of the theological world, that the
        most intelligent and best informed publishers came to the conclusion
        that whatever else theologians differed about, they were all united
        in the determination that such a discussion of these points as was
        sought by the author should not be permitted. And even the editors of
        the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page343">[pg 343]</span><a name=
        "Pg343" id="Pg343" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> secular press were
        urged not to allow their columns to be used for such purposes.</p>

        <span style="font-size: 173%">Chapter LII. The Present Position of
        the Secular Press.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The most decided
        index of the coming agency of the people, in throwing off the
        Augustinian system, is the present position of the secular press.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been shown
        how much the religious press is restrained in liberty of opinion and
        expression, so that it is probable that there is not a professedly
        religious paper in the nation that could controvert the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">distinctive</span></em> doctrines of the sect
        that patronizes it without losing its character and income.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the secular
        press is far less encumbered with such difficulties. The progress of
        this great power toward the discussion of such subjects has been very
        striking. At first there began to be seen simple reports of the
        religious anniversaries in some secular papers. This proving popular,
        next there came notices of missionary and benevolent operations. Then
        notices of the sermons of distinguished clergymen were given, and
        then whole columns of daily papers were occupied with sermons from
        ministers, without regard to denomination. Finally, the great
        <span class="tei tei-q">“revival”</span> became a topic of the
        secular press. Reports of religious meetings, the number who were
        counted as converts, and all the details connected with this great
        popular movement were chronicled in the secular almost as fully as in
        the religious press.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The comments of
        editors, also, on this subject, were <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page344">[pg 344]</span><a name="Pg344" id="Pg344" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> usually respectful, candid, and in many cases
        very able and discriminating. The result has been, that inasmuch as
        the religious press circulates chiefly among <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the church”</span> and the secular press among
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the world,”</span> the gospel has been
        preached to sinners far more by secular than by religious editors.
        And it may be assumed as a fact, that the secular editors of this
        nation have far more power and influence in guiding the religious
        opinions and moral conduct of <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        world”</span> than either the clergy or the religious press, and
        probably more than both combined.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this state of
        the case, all the interests of the religious press are opposed to
        free investigation and discussion, and all the interests of the
        secular press are as powerfully interested to promote it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In appealing,
        therefore, from the theological world to <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        people,”</span> it is the editors of the secular press—the true
        <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Tribunes</span></em> of the people”</span>—who
        will render the verdict, and this verdict is awaited with very little
        doubt or apprehension in regard to its nature.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The questions
        submitted for decision are not so comprehensive as those of the
        volume referred to in which theologians chiefly were invoked, and
        which they have as yet declined to answer. The questions submitted to
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
        people</span></em> are briefly these: Does common sense, or does the
        Bible teach that every human being possesses such a depraved nature
        as never to perform any truly virtuous act until this nature is
        re-created by God? and are the churches organized on the assumption
        that its members are diverse from the world, in that they, as
        regenerated persons, perform virtuous acts as no unregenerated person
        ever does, sanctioned by common sense or by the Bible?</p>

        Do?</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been shown
        that the Augustinian dogma of a depraved nature is the foundation of
        all the large sectarian organizations in this country, and of the
        contentions, evil passions and waste of property resulting from such
        divisions among Christians.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been shown
        that the leading theologians have ceased to defend this dogma, that
        the pastors of churches are practically evading it, that the
        educators of the young are throwing it aside, and that the people in
        all directions are rejecting it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This process of
        eliminating the Augustinian system from the system of common sense
        and the Bible, with which, for ages, it has been entwined, thus far
        has gone on as the result chiefly of the development of the
        intellectual and moral nature of all classes, but especially of the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">common
        people</span></em>. A period has now arrived in which the question
        has become so far an intelligible and a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">practical</span></em>
        one, that the two great principles of society indicated by the words
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">conservatism</span></em> and <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">progress</span></em>
        are arranging and accumulating antagonistic forces for an open and
        decided manifestation on this great question. What will be the
        precise nature of this manifestation no human mind can predict. But
        the distinctive principles of the two parties furnish some data for
        anticipating some future results, as they may occur in the several
        classes referred to in preceding chapters under the following
        heads:</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page346">[pg

          <span style="font-size: 144%">What Theologians will do?</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In attempting to
          indicate the probable future course of theologians, it is important
          to notice the relative positions of persons trained to sustain a
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">system</span></em> of doctrines, and of those
          who seek for truth and duty without any such commitment.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Most theologians
          grow up from infancy under a system of doctrines inculcated both
          from the pulpit and in the family. This enlists all the strong and
          inveterate influences of early education in its favor. Next, the
          collegiate pulpit instructions and associations all favor the same
          system. Next, the theological school brings the young under the
          direct training of the most acute minds, whose express business it
          is to teach all methods of supporting and defending that <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">system</span></em>.
          Here the young minister is taught how to construct his sermons so
          as most effectually to bring the popular mind under its control,
          and so as to most effectively oppose all antagonistic sects and
          teachings.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Finally, the
          office of a clergyman involves such ecclesiastical relations as
          subjects a man to constant espionage, and to ecclesiastical
          discipline and ejection if he adopts any views that would
          essentially modify the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">system</span></em> in which he is trained.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If, therefore,
          any theologian or pastor finds himself doubting as to any doctrine,
          he perceives that it is so interlocked with the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">system</span></em>
          of which it is a part that he is at once brought face to face with
          the question, Shall I give up <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">the whole system</span></em> in which I was
          educated, all the lectures and sermons framed on that system, all
          my ecclesiastical connections, my professional character and my
          salary?</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page347">[pg
          347]</span><a name="Pg347" id="Pg347" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is as if a
          man should find himself in some emergency upholding by a single
          timber a portion of a building which so interlocks with every other
          portion that he can not let it go without throwing down the only
          house that can shelter himself and all he holds dear. In such a
          case a man must come to a decision as to whether the piece of
          timber <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ought</span></em> to be removed, and
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">when</span></em> and <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">how</span></em> it
          should be done, with an anxiety, deliberation and forecast that
          would be inappropriate to a man who finds only a disconnected stick
          of timber in his way. This illustrates the relative position and
          difficulties of theologians in contrast with those which impede the
          common people in the search after truth and duty.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this view of
          the case it would be unreasonable to expect that theologians
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as a
          class</span></em>, though among the wisest and best of men, are to
          be leaders in any great or sudden change in religious opinions. On
          the contrary, it is to be anticipated that they will be the most
          earnest, energetic, and at the same time honest, defenders of
          time-honored religious dogmas, which it is their professional
          business to uphold. Nor is it any implication of their talents,
          learning, honesty or piety to suppose that they will be among the
          last to perceive the fallacies and evils involved in whatever
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">system</span></em> they defend.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet there are
          considerations which indicate that the experience of the past is
          not to be the exact image of the future. The progress of mind is as
          distinctly marked among theologians as it is among any class of
          society, and this being toward the system of common sense, involves
          the waning of the dogmatic spirit of infallibility and the increase
          of that humble and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page348">[pg
          348]</span><a name="Pg348" id="Pg348" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          teachable spirit, which is alike the mark of true philosophy and of
          Christianity.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the infantile
          development of our race mere physical prowess was deemed the chief
          virtue and was the grand aim of all manly culture.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the next
          higher stage of development <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">intellectual power</span></em> became the
          object of highest veneration and assiduous cultivation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The advent of a
          still higher stage of development is now dawning, which is best
          illustrated by the docile spirit of a little child, which feels
          exalted by taking a low place, which understands that true dignity
          and magnanimity consists, not in assumed infallibility, but in a
          modest and humble acknowledgment of ignorance, of mistakes, and of
          the need of knowledge and guidance, not only from God but from
          men.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is believed
          that it is not too much to expect that this stage of high
          development is to be found even among that class most unfavorably
          placed for the attainment of it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Should this be
          the case, there will soon be the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">conservative</span></em> and the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">progressive</span></em> parties among
          theologians; the one holding on to both of the contradictory
          systems, and maintaining their infallibility; the other, openly
          cutting loose from all that conflicts with their common sense and
          moral sense, will manfully and honestly confess their fallibility
          and past mistakes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Between these
          two parties will be a third class, who either from policy or from
          timidity, or from inability to form decided opinions, will maintain
          entire silence as to any thing involving entire commitment to
          either party.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The pastors of
          the people are that class in which the division of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">conservatism</span></em> and <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">progress</span></em> must most immediately and
          most distinctly appear. And the reason is, that the question to
          them is a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">practical</span></em> one, more so than it can
          be to any other class of men.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is their
          business and calling to teach men what they must do to be saved,
          and every week they must appear before the public to give their
          opinions on this very question.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this
          situation, the conservative class will include all who have taken
          the opinions of their theological teachers as an act of memory,
          with very little original thought or investigation. These, being
          helpless as to any ability to investigate or to reason
          independently, will continue to preach and teach in the same round
          as was given them in their course of theological study. Such will
          be alarmed and distressed at the changes in opinion all around
          them, and will mourn over them as departures from the good old
          paths of truth and safely. Such will be sustained chiefly by the
          old and conservative portion of their parishes, while the most
          active minds, both young and old, will become more and more
          restless and dissatisfied, or forsake entirely such
          ministrations.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
          progressive class of pastors, there will be a marked division. The
          first will include those who have clear and decided perceptions of
          truth and duty, and at the same time a full conviction that
          outspoken frankness and honesty is not only a duty, but the best
          policy.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, when they

          "tei tei-anchor"></a> doubtful as to the system in which they have
          been trained, they will, if called to speak, frankly say so. If
          they advance to a new position, and yet are not clear in regard to
          certain connected topics, they will say so. If they are clear that
          the system of Augustine is false, root and branch, they will say
          so, and carry out all the results involved in this position. In
          short, they will go forward in a perfect faith in truth, honesty
          and freedom of speech.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor will they

          of making known their change of opinion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The other
          portion will adopt the policy which assumes that peace and quiet in
          holding error is more important than truth which involves trouble
          and contention. Such will conceal their real opinions under forms
          of expression that will deceive the conservative portion of their
          people, by making the impression that they hold to old creeds and
          formularies, in the sense in which they formerly did, when they do
          not. They will use the stereotyped forms of orthodoxy, knowing that
          those of their people who are alarmed at supposed changes, will be
          quieted by impressions which are false. And they will do this,
          believing it to be Christian expediency, although it is a course
          exactly opposite to that pursued by Christ and his disciples.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In regard to
          church organizations, it has been shown that there are two diverse
          principles on which these organizations may be perpetuated. The
          first is the Augustinian, in which the principle of union is a
          supposed change of the nature transmitted from Adam, <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page351">[pg 351]</span><a name="Pg351" id="Pg351"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> enabling a man to perform truly
          virtuous acts, as none ever do who are not thus re-created. The
          second is that of common sense, in which the principle of union is
          the acknowledgment of Jesus Christ as Lord and Master, and the
          purpose to obey him in all things; or, in the words of the
          Episcopal formula, <span class="tei tei-q">“a church is a
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">congregation</span></em> of faithful men, in
          which the pure word is preached and the sacraments duly
          administered according to Christ's ordinances.”</span> This
          definition, in order to represent the common-sense view, assumes
          that <span class="tei tei-q">“faithful men”</span> are persons who
          believe in Christ's authority, as the Lord of all, and who purpose
          to obey him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been also
          shown, in a previous chapter, that the church organizations based
          on the Augustinian theory, are gradually modifying their practice
          so as more and more to recognize the common-sense principle.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is believed
          that this process of quiet change is to be greatly accelerated by
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">discussion</span></em>. The people are not
          aware that the mode of church organization and discipline now most
          prevalent is an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">innovation</span></em>, which has existed less
          than two centuries, and chiefly in this country, and that there can
          be found no authority for it, either in the Bible or church
          history. The word <span class="tei tei-q">“church,”</span> as used
          in the New Testament, in the original Greek means <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">congregation</span></em>, and includes all who
          unite in one assembly to worship.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No case can be
          found in the Bible of any such organization as corresponds with
          that which is now called by the name of <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“church,”</span> as distinct from the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“congregation.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These being
          facts, the whole matter of church organization <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page352">[pg 352]</span><a name="Pg352" id="Pg352"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and discipline is soon to become a
          matter of general discussion, the result of which, of course, can
          not be predicted in any details. But it is certain that the more
          discussion there is, the more the common-sense system will become
          dominant. And it is certain that the portion of the people
          connected with churches will more and more demand discussion. They
          will assume that their pastors are not to be their authoritative,
          dogmatic teachers; but their leaders in worship and ordinances;
          their presiding officers in discussions, and the administers of
          much of that kind of knowledge needed by the people, to enable them
          to act independently in interpreting the Bible for themselves.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The great
          principle of Protestantism, in distinction from Catholicism, is,
          that every person is to be an independent interpreter of the Bible,
          responsible to no man or body of men; and that every person is to
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">protest</span></em> against all that conflicts
          with this right.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This principle
          carried out consistently, makes theologians and pastors a class
          sustained by the people, not as dogmatic teachers of their own
          opinions, but as persons set apart for the purpose of gaining and
          of communicating to the people all the knowledge needful to fit
          them to use their rights as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">authorized interpreters of the
          Bible</span></em>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But though all
          Protestants hold this principle theoretically, by far the larger
          portion have never practically adopted it, but, as a matter of
          fact, go to theologians and pastors for their <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=

          353]</span><a name="Pg353" id="Pg353" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          that ecclesiastics control the faith of a large portion of the
          Protestant churches, as authoritatively as do the pope and priests
          control that of the Catholic church.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have seen, in

          her religious teachers must be authoritative guides of her
          opinions, and that her own common sense and moral sense must bow to
          ecclesiastical dictation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The present time

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been
          stated that many intelligent and pious women in various parts of
          our country have already quietly assumed their rights as authorized
          interpreters of the Bible on all these questions, have cast off the
          Augustinian theory, and thus, in fret, have set themselves in
          opposition to the clergy, except so far as the clergy themselves
          have come to the same results. The writer, in this work, has done
          little more than has also been done by many pious and intelligent
          mothers and teachers, except to define, methodize and publicly
          express opinions which other women have <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">practically</span></em> adopted in training
          children, as the result of their own experience, common sense and
          study of the Bible.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some of the
          leading organs of the High Church party in the Episcopal church,
          and thus the most strenuous defenders of ecclesiastical
          infallibility and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page355">[pg
          355]</span><a name="Pg355" id="Pg355" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          authority, in noticing the writer's volume, <span class=

          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">naive</span></em> simplicity, what right has a
          woman to apply common sense to religion, or to have any opinions
          except as she is taught them by the church, at the same time
          sneering at the idea, that <span class="tei tei-q">“the dear
          people”</span> are competent to understand and interpret the Bible
          for themselves.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This shows that
          the issue is now fairly presented and understood. The
          ecclesiastical party, more or less, openly claim that the only
          authorized interpreters of the Bible are the ordained priesthood,
          or the regenerated church. On the other hand, the people, and
          women, as that half of the people to whom the training of the human
          mind is especially committed, maintain that they are ordained to
          this office by a Higher Power and by the imposition of a nobler
          hand than any who boast an uninterrupted apostolical
          succession.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Moreover, it is
          claimed that every well-educated, pious woman of good common sense,
          who has trained young children, is <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">better</span></em>
          qualified to interpret the Bible correctly, on all points
          pertaining to such practical duties, than most theologians possibly
          can be. And the reasons are, that she is free from those biasing
          difficulties which have been pointed out as embarrassing
          theologians, while all her employments and all her culture
          eminently tend to aid rather than to embarrass her judgment on such
          subjects.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Add, also, that
          the Bible was written for common people, and not for
          metaphysicians, and in the language of common life, and not in
          theological terms, and that if it teaches the system of common
          sense, it is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page356">[pg
          356]</span><a name="Pg356" id="Pg356" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          better fitted to the apprehension of those whose training has been
          practical rather than scholastic.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Finally, the
          promises of aid from the Author of the Bible, is to the meek and
          lowly of heart. <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">The
          meek</span></em> will he guide in judgment; <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
          meek</span></em> will he teach his way.”</span> That the position
          of those accustomed to rule and teach is as favorable to the
          cultivation of a meek, humble and teachable spirit as that of those
          trained to learn and to obey, few will maintain.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These facts
          being so, it is believed that ere long the greater portion of the
          most intelligent and conscientious women in this country, will
          gradually and quietly take this course. They will perceive that
          they are bound, not only to assume and exercise the distinctive
          rights of Protestantism, as authorized interpreters of the Bible,
          but to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">protest</span></em>, by word and deed, against
          all that opposes the exercise of these rights.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In accordance
          with this, they will respectfully and privately express to their
          pastor and fellow-Christians their <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">protest</span></em>
          against the Augustinian system, as involving a dreadful slander on
          their Lord and Saviour, vailing in mystery and gloom his lovely
          character, which is the light and life of the soul; they will
          protest against every creed or confession or church ordinance that
          is based on this system, as an indorsement of this fatal slander;
          they will protest against being regarded as members of a church in
          any other sense than as persons united with a <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">congregation</span></em> to sustain the
          worship and ordinances instituted by Christ, and to aid each other
          in obeying his word; they will make it clear to all concerned, that
          they do not claim to possess any other <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em>
          than that received from God at birth, nor to be regenerated in any
          other sense than <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page357">[pg
          357]</span><a name="Pg357" id="Pg357" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          that they now desire and sincerely purpose to obey Christ in all
          things.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They will,
          moreover, protest against the exclusion of themselves or their
          children from the Lord's table, for interpreting the Bible
          diversely from the church with which they worship, and against the
          interference of church officers to examine them or their children
          in order to ascertain their mode of interpreting the Bible or the
          any other signs of regeneration, than the expressed desire to unite
          with the congregation in the worship and ordinances appointed by
          Christ.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Should such a
          course as this result in exclusion from the Lord's table, those
          thus protesting can depart peaceably to some church which could
          conscientiously receive them on such terms. And if no such church
          is to be found, they can quietly relinquish the privilege, until
          such time as it can be enjoyed without a sacrifice of principle and
          religious liberty.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If those thus
          protesting act consistently, they will accord to the church
          excluding them the same liberty to interpret the Bible, in regard
          to duty on this subject, as they claim for themselves. The church
          in cutting them off may feel as conscientiously bound to the course
          they adopt, according to their way of understanding the Bible, as
          those do who protest and withdraw. And if the true spirit of
          Christ, the spirit of humility, meekness and love prevails, such
          disruptions will occur without contentions or ill feelings on
          either side.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But in churches
          embracing many who possess very little of this spirit and
          cherishing the claim of infallibility,—first in deciding which is
          the true church and next in maintaining its dogmas,—there would
          result a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page358">[pg
          358]</span><a name="Pg358" id="Pg358" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          mode of dealing with such <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Protestants</span></em> very similar to that
          of former ages. This would lead to agitation and discussion. But
          even on this trying alternative more good than evil might be hoped,
          especially if those who protest and withdraw, maintain the meek,
          peaceable and quiet spirit required and exhibited by their
          Master.</p>

          they are in this life? What are our dangers? What are we to do to
          escape them? This is more and more the agonizing demand of
          humanity.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been
          shown that a system of doctrine has been forced upon Christendom
          which has shrouded this great question in mysterious gloom. It has
          been shown also that the great <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">organizations</span></em>
          of the religious world are so vitally based on this system that its
          renunciation involves their certain dissolution. And though the
          advance of humanity has, more or less, modified the opinions and
          practice of the individuals embraced in such organizations, still
          the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">principle</span></em> remains unchanged.
          Consequently any formal, open attack on this principle involves the
          combined antagonism of all the most powerful religious
          organizations of society.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Free</span></em>
          discussion is not to be expected in our theological <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page359">[pg 359]</span><a name="Pg359" id="Pg359"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> schools, where the young men know that
          they can not be recommended for license if they fail to adopt the
          creed of their sect. Nor can it be found in our colleges, most of
          which depend for patronage on, or are pledged to the interests of a
          sect. Nor can it be expected in our pulpits, where the minister
          teaches and the people have no chance of rejoinder or disputation.
          Nor can it be expected of the religious press, which is also bound
          to sustain sectarian interests. What power is there then which can
          contend against such portentous combinations, sustained not only by
          the prestige of ages and all the innate forces of long-drilled
          organizations, but by the honest and conscientious convictions of
          the great majorities thus enrolled?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the power of truth
          evolved by free discussion</span></em>, and mainly as it is and
          will be administered in the hands of <em class=

          America</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">the secular press</span></em>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The young men of
          the nation have the control of their literary societies in our
          colleges and seminaries, and of the popular lyceums and other
          associations, where every member has a vote in deciding what shall
          be discussed; and here the battle will be fought for religious
          liberty and the Bible.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this conflict
          there will appear two distinct classes. The first will be those of
          shallow capacity and acquirements, who, perceiving themselves to be
          in the party of reason and common sense, will imagine that they
          have acquired this position, not by the progress of the age,
          brought about to a great extent by the discussions, the labors and
          sufferings of wise and good men, many of them distinguished as
          metaphysicians and theologians, but that it is all owing to their
          own remarkable genius and independent thought. Thus <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page360">[pg 360]</span><a name="Pg360" id="Pg360"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> they will become <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“heady, high-minded,”</span> rash and contemptuous. Of
          these, some will be borne away to utter skepticism, immorality and
          final ruin. Others, unable to reason correctly, and bewildered by
          the conflict, will swing around to the opposite extreme, and enter
          a church where they can rest their faith on a priesthood claiming
          to be heaven-inspired, which shall decide all questions of faith
          and practice for them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the nobler
          portion of Young America will understand truly their great mission,
          and, taught by the mistakes and darkness of the past, with a modest
          and humble sense of their own inability to go forward without help,
          both from God and their fellow-men, will seek for truth, duty and
          happiness in the appropriate path of <em class=

          do?</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This question is
          the most perplexing of all, at least to those who have attentively
          marked the recent developments in the religious world.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What is there
          that more clearly defies at once the moral sense, the common sense
          and the teachings of the Bible, than the system of slavery as it
          now exists in this country, and yet a majority of not only editors,
          but of the ministers of Christ, in some of our most intelligent and
          large denominations, openly refuse freedom of discourse on this
          subject; nay, more, some of the religious papers are openly
          justifying the slave trade, which politicians, even those without
          any <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page361">[pg 361]</span><a name=
          "Pg361" id="Pg361" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> pretensions to
          religious principle, have placed as piracy, the highest civil
          crime.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And the last
          year has witnessed the deliberate crushing of free debate on this
          subject, in one of our largest and most effective benevolent
          associations. And some of those whose whole lives have exhibited
          them among the most amiable, conscientious and exemplary men, are
          to be found upholding such a course.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Who then can
          predict what will be the course of the religious press, when every
          editor must maintain the distinctive tenets of a sect, or at once
          lose his professional character and his income?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is very easy
          to predict what will be the course of those who will make no
          sacrifice for truth. A large portion will neither read, or think or
          discuss, or, so far as they have power to prevent, allow others to
          do so. Some will take this course in the satisfied belief that
          they, and the church which they have infallibly decided to be
          infallible, can never err. Others will avoid all discussion for
          fear of being convinced of mistakes, obliging them, if
          acknowledged, to sacrifices of pride, character and income.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Others will make
          some show of discussion, so far as to use the disgraceful arts
          sometimes resorted to, in order to satisfy and blind ignorant and
          unreflecting readers. Unfair and garbled quotations, misstatement
          of facts, depreciating implications of character and motives,
          invidious allusions to family or party connections, the use of
          unpopular terms, which humbler minds have been trained to regard as
          designating the most dangerous and destructive heresies, these, and
          many other discreditable methods, will <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page362">[pg 362]</span><a name="Pg362" id="Pg362" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> probably be employed to stave off discussion,
          or to nullify its power.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But there is a
          class of minds who have access to the religious press, and can more
          or less control its action, who are far above such humiliating
          littleness and dishonesty. In regard to these, such are the
          influence of education and long-trained habits of thought, that an
          entire change of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">whole system</span></em> must be a gradual
          process. And when sermons, lectures, books and pulpit ministries
          have all been in accordance with one system, they can not be
          modified to meet another without many practical difficulties. Nor
          can men, whose professional associations with ecclesiastical bodies
          and with parishes impede them, settle many practical questions
          involved in any change of views, without demanding <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">time</span></em>
          for reflection, examination and consultation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this position
          of affairs in the religious world, a measure of retention, and even
          of protracted silence, in many cases, may be wise and justifiable.
          And charges of compromise, or of cowardice, or of intellectual
          deficiency, in such cases, would be false, ungenerous and unjust.
          All this should be taken into account in judging of the future
          action of those who control the religious periodicals and
          literature.</p>

          <span style="font-size: 144%">What the Secular Press will
          do?</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The answer to
          this question is much more clear than the preceding one, inasmuch
          as the secular press, to a great extent, is free from the
          embarrassments that restrain the religious press.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has become so
          manifest that the great body of the people are determined to enjoy
          perfect liberty of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page363">[pg
          363]</span><a name="Pg363" id="Pg363" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          conscience, and to defend the right of free discussion in religion
          and morals, as well as in politics, that it is clearly for the
          interests of editors, not committed to sectarianism, to uphold
          these rights.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
          distinguished popularity and success of that Daily which now boasts
          the largest circulation in the nation, is a most significant fact.
          Its career began long before the religious world had its
          distinctive tenets rudely assailed by any but ecclesiastical hands,
          and long before the secular press ventured to bring its
          common-sense maxims to bear on religious topics.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Single-handed,
          it fearlessly opened its columns to discussions on Fourierism,
          women's rights, intemperance, slavery, religious doctrines, and all
          other matters that concerned the public weal, giving every party a
          fair chance to speak for itself. The religious world took the lead
          in the outcry and alarm against this course. But <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
          people</span></em>, and even a large proportion of the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">religious
          people</span></em>, sustained this attempt at fair and free
          discussion, so honestly and fearlessly pursued, until the battle
          was fairly won. And now it is probable that the larger proportion
          of the most candid and intelligent editors of the secular press
          perceive that their pecuniary interests, in regard to free
          religious discussion, are in the same direction as their reason and
          conscience.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This being so,
          it is probable that the most powerful, fair and effective
          discussions of the grand question of life hereafter, will be found
          more in the secular than in the religious press, at least for a
          considerable period of time.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Should this be
          so, there would probably be an <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page364">[pg 364]</span><a name="Pg364" id="Pg364" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> improvement in <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">modes</span></em>
          of discussion in several respects.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among these may
          be anticipated an advance in a spirit of Christian humility,
          charity and of gentlemanly courtesy in dealing with the character
          and motives of those whose opinions, either in religion or morals,
          are discussed. The true spirit of Christian charity demands that we
          endeavor to present the best rather than the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">worst</span></em>
          construction of our opponent's character, motives and
          arguments.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A true humility
          implies such a self-distrust, and such a sense of our need of aid
          in discovering truth, not only from God but from our fellow-men, as
          will be indicated in a modest and unimpassioned exhibition of
          opinions and arguments, and a courteous reception of all criticisms
          and counter arguments. With this spirit the weakness or mistakes,
          or sophistries of an opponent would be exhibited more in sorrow
          than in triumph or scorn.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A true
          gentlemanly courtesy would enforce the same rules of delicacy and
          good breeding in public encounters as are regarded by well-bred
          persons in the drawing room. This would necessarily banish all
          allusion to personal or family failings, and all invidious or
          disrespectful modes of address or language.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No one who is
          familiar with the controversies on doctrine and morals, as
          conducted in the religious papers, can doubt that there is room for
          improvement in all these particulars.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such improvement
          is to be anticipated, not on account of any mental or moral
          superiority of the conductors of the secular press, but rather from
          the fact that they are free from many of the embarrassments
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page365">[pg 365]</span><a name=
          "Pg365" id="Pg365" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and exciting
          influences already pointed out as surrounding those who conduct the
          religious periodicals.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another
          improvement to be anticipated is the withdrawal of the great
          questions in debate from the mists of metaphysical and theological
          technics to the clear, popular language of common life.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the preceding
          pages it is shown that the most important questions of religious
          truth and duty can be discussed in the language of common life, so
          as to be made intelligible to all persons of ordinary education,
          who are sufficiently interested to give their attention to matters
          which demand intellectual exertion. Men will find that they must
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">labor</span></em> to enter into the strait
          gate,”</span> intellectually as well as morally, and that they are
          to <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">work</span></em> out their own salvation with
          fear and trembling,”</span> while thus they will learn to
          understand the nature of the encouraging assurance that
          <span class="tei tei-q">“it is God that worketh in us <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">to will and to
          do</span></span> of his own good pleasure.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When, therefore,
          the secular press and the popular lyceum take up these great
          questions they will insist that the discussions shall be carried on
          in popular language, so that the labor demanded shall not be
          increased by the unknown tongue of theological and metaphysical
          science.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, there
          will be an improvement in the mode of conducting such discussions,
          by the banishment of all adventitious topics and the firm grasping
          of the one great fundamental point in debate. It will be insisted
          that the question is not at all whether Arminians or Universalists,
          or Unitarians hold this or that opinion, nor whether advocating
          such and such views would injure the cause of this or that
          institution, or <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page366">[pg
          366]</span><a name="Pg366" id="Pg366" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          sect or individual; nor whether this or that person has certain
          faults, or is a proper advocate of some innovations; nor whether
          undesirable results would follow from expressing certain views, but
          simply <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">what is the truth</span></em>, so far as it
          can be discovered by honest statements and fair discussion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The grand
          question in debate is not whether men are <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">depraved</span></em> in <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">character and
          action</span></em> as they appear in the history of the world. All
          parties agree in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">fact</span></em> of such dreadful depravity.
          The question is in regard to the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">philosophy</span></em> of this fact, that is
          to say, What is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">cause</span></em> or reason of this
          depravity?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here it will be
          found that two classes exist in all the great Protestant sects,
          viz.:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Those who hold
          that the cause is a depraved <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">nature</span></em>, [signifying what men mean
          when in common life they use the terms, <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em>,
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">organization</span></em>, <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=

          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">constitution</span></em>,] and those who deny
          that any such depraved nature exists. These two opposite opinions,
          ever since the third century, have been expressed by the terms,
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Augustinian</span></em> and <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Pelagian</span></em>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The case is now
          so fairly and clearly before <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">the people</span></em>, that every theologian
          who has capacity and training sufficient to understand an argument
          must knowingly do one of these things:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1. Deny
          depravity of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">nature</span></em> and allow that he is a
          Pelagian; or</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. Affirm such
          depravity, take rank as an Augustinian and then meet the argument
          which, on this assumption, destroys all evidence of the benevolence
          of God, and renders a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">reliable</span></em> revelation from him
          impossible.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. Withdraw from
          all discussion either by entire <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page367">[pg 367]</span><a name="Pg367" id="Pg367" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> silence, or by hiding in the fogs of
          metaphysical and theological technics, or by the disgraceful arts
          of debate practiced to alarm and delude the ignorant.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Heretofore the
          editors of secular papers have practically conceded that the
          religious disputes and conflicts that agitated the churches were
          matters out of their province and to be turned over to the clergy
          and religious editors. And inasmuch as most of these contentions
          have related to matters of rites and forms, or to abstract
          doctrinal points having little <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">practical</span></em>
          bearings on the daily life, such abstinence seemed appropriate. But
          the progress of the age has at last fairly brought the organized
          church front to front with the unregenerate world on the greatest
          of all <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">practical</span></em> questions-a question
          with which every editor of every secular paper has as deep a
          personal and family interest as has any religious editor, or any
          doctor of theology, or any parochial pastor.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Is it <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a fact</span></em>,
          or is it not, that every man at birth is so depraved in <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em>
          that every one of his moral acts is <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sin</span></em>,
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">and sin
          only</span></em>, until a change in this <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em>
          is wrought by the creative power of God, and must all young
          children be educated on this assumption?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The training of
          the family, our institutions of education, the church organizations
          of the great religious sects, all depend on this question. The
          answer to it must be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">yes</span></em> or <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no</span></em>, for
          no third supposition is possible. Every <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">intelligent</span></em> man then must speak
          out in the affirmative, or in the negative, or else hide in silence
          or in the mists of deceit.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this view of
          the case, it is believed that the educated class of powerful and
          cultivated minds, who <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page368">[pg
          368]</span><a name="Pg368" id="Pg368" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          are, by their position and talents, the leaders of the secular
          press, will not turn this matter over to their theological
          contributors, but will take the case into their own hands, and
          fearlessly and earnestly meet their high responsibilities.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus they may
          prove not only the most effective leaders in the intellectual and
          moral advance of humanity, but the protectors of many suffering,
          struggling minds, who unaided would sink in the conflict before
          them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this
          exhibition of the position of the religious world, the attitude of
          this work is very remarkable. It is in open and direct antagonism
          with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">all</span></em> the religious <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">organizations</span></em> of the Christian
          world, and that too in regard to the very fundamentals on which
          each of these organizations depends for its existence. All the
          Augustinian sects are against the position of this work, that the
          mind of man is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">perfect in nature</span></em>, and should they
          adopt the Pelagian ground <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">consistently</span></em>, every one of them
          would either come to an end, or change the very basis of its
          organization.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The only sect
          that openly and consistently avows the Pelagian view, is the
          Unitarian; but this organization is founded on the distinctive
          tenet of such a unity in God as forbids the idea of a plurality of
          eternal, self-existent Persons, having the highest attributes of
          God. This is contrary to the system of common sense, as exhibited
          in this work, page 100. The Universalist organization is based on
          the doctrine that none of the human race will continue sinful for
          ever, and thus insure the natural consequences of sin. This also is
          shown to be contrary to the system <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page369">[pg 369]</span><a name="Pg369" id="Pg369" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> of common sense, as presented in this work,
          page 177.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The great body
          of persons, as yet unorganized, who agree in resisting the claims
          of the Bible as containing reliable revelations from the Creator,
          and thus <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">authoritative</span></em> rules of faith and
          practice, will be arrayed against such claims maintained in this
          work, as one of the inevitable results of the application of the
          principles of common sense.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Consequently,
          the whole religious organizations of the world, who rest their
          faith on the Bible, are antagonistic to this work, while those who
          repudiate the authority of the Bible are equally so.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Still more
          remarkable is the fact exhibited in this volume, that the writer,
          in a family circle embracing so many theologians and pastors,
          appears before the public as antagonistic to most, and supported
          openly by not one of them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What then is the
          foundation of that confiding and cheerful equanimity with which all
          this imposing array of organizations and individual talents,
          learning and influence is regarded? It is, first, confidence in
          truth and the God of truth, and next, the intimate knowledge gained
          by the writer, of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">characters</span></em> and the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mental
          experiences</span></em> of some of the most powerful minds that are
          leaders of this host, and at the same time a similar knowledge of
          some of the noblest minds, who are most effectively influencing
          that great portion of the popular mind which is not embraced in
          these organizations. Whatever may be the opinions of these powerful
          classes, who may in form and position appear antagonistic, they
          will never be leaders in any attempt to crush perfect freedom of
          thought <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page370">[pg
          370]</span><a name="Pg370" id="Pg370" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          and expression, or to restrain that free and earnest discussion
          which is impending.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nay more, if the
          distinctive feature of a follower of Christ is to be humble and
          teachable in spirit, <span class="tei tei-q">“meek and lowly of
          heart,”</span> and if that highest form of human development is
          dawning, when moral magnanimity shall take precedence of
          intellectual power in human estimation, then the world will soon
          behold what as yet has been deemed impossible, great and learned
          men, even doctors in theology, nay more, even men that have written
          books, resigning the claim of infallibility, and confessing that
          they have made mistakes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The hope of
          this, moreover, is sustained by the character and position of some,
          who not only stand high in the theological world, but are among the
          most revered and beloved in that family circle, where the golden
          chain of perfect love has never for a moment been sundered by the
          widest diversities of opinion or the freest discussion of
          differences. What has transpired in one Christian family, it is
          believed, may be but the emblem of what is yet to prevail among the
          true children of Him, <span class="tei tei-q">“of whom the whole
          family in heaven and on earth is named.”</span><a id="noteref_22"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The new school
          divines agree with the old school in teaching that previous to
          regeneration every moral act is <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sin and only
          sin</span></em>, and that God has made no promises to unregenerate
          doings, which would obligate him to re-create the soul, in return
          for such performances.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the contrary,
          they urge man himself to change his own heart, as that which is
          possible without any aid from God. And the interference of God to
          regenerate is represented by them as an act of sovereign, elective
          mercy, unbought by any labor or striving on the part of man.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Still, they
          encourage the use of the means of grace as the way in which God

          points on the subject of the future state, which need to be
          discussed separately.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first is,
          will there be an eventual separation of the human race, at some
          final consummation, so that from that point, through all eternity,
          there will be two separate communities, the good being perfect in
          character and happiness, and the bad reaping the natural results of
          their evil tempers and conduct <em class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second is,
          does our conduct in this life have an influence in deciding our
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">degrees</span></em> of happiness or misery in
          a future state, so that we reap the natural good or evil
          consequences of all we do here <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for
          ever</span></em>?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The third is
          entirely independent of the other two, and is this: Is the

          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every</span></em>
          human being fixed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">some</span></em> a continued process of
          culture and discipline, and of upward and downward progress in a
          future state, extending to the day of final separation and
          consummation?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">some</span></em>
          may become so good in this life as to insure an eternal upward
          progress, and that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          insure a perpetual downward progress, may be true, and yet, to
          others new opportunities may be given.</p>

          that these points can be effectually settled. It is shown in
          chapter 27, that every system of religion or morals must be decided
          by these questions. Therefore, these questions, and the authority

          the Atonement can be regarded simply as a fact without any

          the mode or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          into this world to save men from sin and its inevitable penalties,
          by his teachings, sufferings and death.</span></span> This fact may
          be received without any attempt to explain the <em class=

          the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          made efficacious, which are the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">philosophy</span></em> of this fact.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In regard to
          this philosophy, various theories have been incorporated into
          creeds and theological systems.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The most common
          theory at the present time, in this country, is, that the
          sufferings and the death of Christ avail to sustain the justice and
          the laws of God as effectually as would the infliction of eternal
          misery on all who are regenerated. That is to say, if by repentance
          and reformation, without an atonement, men should escape all the
          penalties for past sin, the result would be that <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page374">[pg 374]</span><a name="Pg374" id="Pg374"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> God's justice would be impeached and
          his laws be nullified, just as human lawgivers become unjust and
          their laws are made void when all penalties are remitted. This
          difficulty, it is supposed, on the common theory, was met by the
          sufferings and the death of Jesus Christ, as a <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vicarious
          substitute</span></em> in behalf of those saved. That is to say,
          this atoning sacrifice operates to preserve the justice of God and
          the efficiency of laws, as effectually as would the eternal
          punishment, from which all regenerated persons are thus
          rescued.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This mode of

          be relinquished and another mode adopted, or no theory at all may
          be deemed needful, while belief may remain in the great <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fact</span></em>,
          that Jesus Christ wrought out the salvation of those who are saved,
          by his advent, sufferings and death, and that they could be saved
          by no other mode.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is very
          important to recognize this distinction between the <em class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The theory which
          this author adopts is, that the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“normal”</span> state of man's <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          "tei tei-q">“a habit of sinning,”</span> generated in this
          preëxistent state.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This habit of
          sinning was not a part of the perfectly-constructed nature made by
          God. Man himself introduced it into his own mind, thus rendering it
          so depraved that every moral act is sin, and only sin.</p>

          <span class="tei tei-q">“habit of sinning”</span> can be lessened
          or removed by some supernatural change of the <span class=

          born with this depravity which God <em class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is manifest,
          therefore, that this writer holds to a depravity of <em class=

          in the true and proper sense of the term, signifying constitution

          "font-style: italic">reliable</span></em> guide to truth and
          happiness.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For it is the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          proves the character and intentions of its creator. If then all

          author is debarred from any proof of a preëxistent state by
          revelation.</p>

          these principles [of honor and right], it is of great importance,
          for purposes of revision, carefully to study those developments of

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This passage
          shows that this depravity of the <span class="tei tei-q">“moral

          suggested, is lessened <span class="tei tei-q">“after

          to guide their unregenerate fellow-men in matters of truth and
          duty. This lays the foundation for the claims of a regenerate
          church and clergy to superior authority in deciding on the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Is such a man a
          Christian, or is he not? Guided only by the above extract, it would
          be very difficult to decide, or to state what is this author's view
          of regeneration; nor is there any thing in his published writings
          to remove the vagueness and uncertainty caused by such teachings as
          are embraced in the above extract, as to what <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">change</span></em>
          makes a man a true Christian.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to the
          system of common sense (as explained chapter 24, and also on page
          258) to form and carry out a ruling purpose to obey the laws of
          God, as made known by Jesus Christ, is loving God and Christ in the
          only way in which love can justly be made a subject of command. And
          when a man forms and carries out such a purpose, he is <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“under the dominion of conscience,”</span> and is a
          true Christian.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The point where
          this writer seems to fail, in this extract, is, in a want of the
          distinction, pointed out in the chapter above mentioned, between
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">voluntary</span></em> and <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">involuntary</span></em> love. A person may be
          <span class="tei tei-q">“under the dominion of conscience,”</span>
          by a purpose to obey all the laws of God, and for want of the true
          view of God's character, as exhibited in Jesus Christ, may
          experience only emotions of fear and awe in performing such
          obedience.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is the true,
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">efficient</span></em> purpose to obey Christ
          which constitutes a man a Christian. It is right views of God's
          character, as seen in Jesus Christ, that gives new <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">strength</span></em> to carry out such a
          purpose.</p>

          Christ died for the ungodly,”</span> thus giving new motives of
          love and gratitude, in addition to those of fear and awe. Not until
          all the false theories that hitherto have vailed the atoning
          sacrifice of Jesus Christ are cast away, will the full meaning of
          the above text be fully understood.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among
          theologians and pastors there are two classes now existing, in all
          the great Protestant sects, the one holding to a <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em>
          depravity of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">nature</span></em>, and striving to make such
          a fact consistent with common sense and with the ideas of
          benevolence and justice in the Creator; the other, holding only to
          a depravity of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">action</span></em> and of character, resulting
          from such action in this life, are striving to evade open
          antagonism with the Augustinian theory.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No third
          position being possible, every man is necessarily Augustinian or
          Pelagian; either holding that man <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em>
          depraved <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">in nature</span></em>, or that he is
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">not</span></em>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the first
          class, is one whom, above all others, the writer would prefer to
          meet in a discussion on this great question. <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page379">[pg 379]</span><a name="Pg379" id="Pg379"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> It is one who is remembered in early
          life as the honest, serious, book-loving boy; next as the earnest
          Christian and faithful student, winning the highest honors of a
          collegiate course; next as a student of theology called to several
          of the highest city pulpits, even before finishing his preparatory
          course; next, even in youth, the president of a flourishing western
          college, taking a decided stand on the slavery question, defending
          the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">freedom of the press</span></em> with its
          first martyr, and very nearly sharing his fate; next resuming the
          pastor's office, mainly to gain more freedom to write and publish
          his peculiar views, which he well understood would encounter all
          the organized interests of Christendom, and place a drag-chain on
          all his personal and professional interests; finally, one who, as
          scholar, metaphysician and theologian, in the writer's view, has
          never been surpassed, while he never has, and never will, resort to
          a cowardly or unfair mode to weaken or escape an argument. Thus
          much, if not allowable toward a brother, may be permitted toward an
          antagonist.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is this
          brother who for years has been laboring to sustain the Augustinian
          dogma by a theory which—could it be proved—is the only one yet
          devised that is at once rational, intelligible and actually secures
          the end designed. For if it were a fact that the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em>
          of mind is depraved, and if it were possible to prove that our race
          originally, in a preëxistent state, were created with a perfect
          nature, ruined themselves, and were born into this world for
          purposes of pardon and redemption, the grand difficulty <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">would</span></em>
          all be remedied, and God <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">could</span></em> be exhibited as wise, just
          and good in spite of this mournful fact.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it is
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
          fact</span></em> of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">depraved nature</span></em> of the human mind,
          where the writer and this brother are at issue, and not on any
          theory to relieve the difficulties incident to that fact.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The argument of
          this work, to prove that there is no possible mode of proving the
          benevolence of God, or of proving that the Bible is a reliable
          revelation from him, to any man who teaches that the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em>
          of the human mind is depraved in <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">any</span></em>
          sense that can be made intelligible by human language, <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> is
          the place where the author of the Conflict of Ages, in due time,
          will meet this discussion fairly, openly and honorably.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the second
          class, mentioned above, is another brother, whom the writer
          believes to be as decidedly on the Pelagian ground. <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page380">[pg 380]</span><a name="Pg380" id="Pg380"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Whether he yet fully understands his
          position, is not affirmed by one, who has, for so short a time,
          fully understood her own bearings in this matter. But ere long, the
          only question remaining for him will be, whether he shall openly
          attack this strongly-entrenched error, this wholesale slander on
          his Lord and Master, or take the Tract Society mode of evading
          discussion. All who best know the writer of the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Star
          Papers</span></span>, best understand that any question of
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">expediency</span></em> will relate, not to the
          fearless, outspoken exhibition of his opinions, but only to the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">time</span></em> and <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">manner</span></em>
          in which it shall be done. He must soon perceive that it is as much
          his duty openly to attack the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">African</span></em>[A] enslavement of
          Anglo-Saxon <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will be
          noticed that this public appeal to family friends was not made
          until all other theologians, especially obligated to meet this

            This leads to the same sort of confusion as would result from

              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important

              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the

              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>
